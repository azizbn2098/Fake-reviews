Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"I ordered 4 boxes. Three basically had the same commons in all three boxes and there were easily 30-60 of any given card. The 4th box was mostly Blue (cards massively repeated, many over copies) and the rest of the commons were green. The commons were mostly junk commons (no lightning bolts/shocks/wild growth/counterspell type cards). One box came with 2-3 rares. The others had 4 or 5 but they were largely repeated across boxes. Some uncommon came in sets of four to fourteen. (4 of 11 or more copies) Nothing exceptional. I must have enough prodigal sorcerers by now to assure that they could go into every blue deck I will ever make again without ever reusing any of them. Condition was also an issue on more cards than I expected. The patterns of the commons almost made the repeats seem intentional, especially where five different cards would repeat 6-8 times in one section and then again later. All four boxes were underfilled. Don't waste your money or your time. These doesn't even make for a good beginner's collection because it lacks most of Magic's most important commons. No counterspell in four boxes???? Really? Oh and expect about 20 Circles of Protection. They've been printed in a lot of sets. At least there were 6-10 Healing Salves. Oh, and in 4 boxes, 1 Raging Goblin, which has been reprinted so many times it should be in every box. No basic land, so there is that."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"This skirt is TINY & TIGHT. I'm talking SKIN-tight. For reference I'm 5'7 and 175 lbs I usually wear a size 10. I originally ordered a size XL (which according to the manufacturer is a size 14 - 16, which is WAY bigger than I ever wear). It was STILL TOO SMALL and insanely TIGHT. I ordered an XXL (which apparently is a size 18-20!!!!!) It's a bit looser around the waist, but still pretty tight the rest of the way down. Honestly - and surprisingly - this skirt is really probably most flattering on a smaller sized body - guess they don't call it a pencil skirt for no reason. I do think it's extremely cute though, despite it not being the best fit.

Two other things: you can absolutely see a panty-line. You can't see through all the way to the undies, but the line is quite obviously there.

Second, I ordered the ""coral"" color, which looks neon pink in the pictures, I was pleasantly surprised to find out when it arrived that it's actually not neon pink, but a very pretty baby-pink color. So, I have no idea what the actual ""pink"" shade looks like, since the coral color is actually a very pretty, light shade of pink...."

I also use it on my dogs when I'm away from the house, because it's easier to carry around than the other ones I've used. The material is nice and thick, so I feel it's a great value.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these in size 10.5 wide.  I normally wear size 11 wide sneakers, but these are a touch big.  No big deal.

They look very sharp!  I wear them with or without socks, with pants, with jeans, with shorts.  I live in NYC and walk everywhere, and these shoes are just so comfortable.

I have flat feet, so I can't wear shoes which have a pronounced hump in the insole.  The insole of these shoes is nice and flat, which I love, but you may not like that.

The grip is nice, too; I walked on some spilled water on a tile floor and didn't feel any slippage.

I plan on buying another pair in a different color to back these ones up.  The only thing stopping a 5-star review is that there are some rough edges on the inside, which can make them uncomfortable when wearing sock-less.  However, I'm finding those rough edges are smoothing out the more I wear the shoes, so we'll see!

UPDATE: The inside seams of the shoes really smoothed out after two weeks of wear (I wore short socks for the first two weeks). Now, the shoes are very comfy without socks as well!"

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Desire: The Dining Club: Part One is the first short story in an eight part series. Since this is a short story, this review will be brief.

I don't really have much to say about it. The writing isn't awful, but it grows a bit redundant, vocabulary-wise (for example, David says a lot of things quietly).

My main issue is as follows: nothing happens in this first book. It feels like someone took the first chapter of a novel and released it independently. This first part only discusses what the club is, and that Grace is to visit. You don't really learn about the characters much and they come off as cold.

This novella gets two stars based on the concept. I'd very much like to see how this goes. However, I'm not going to collect pieces of eight like it's some kind of literary trading card. I'd rather just wait until they're all out and read them as one full length book than sit through snippets like this. I'd very much recommend that other readers do the same.

Thanks to Netgalley and Forever (Grand Central Publishing) for my copy in exchange for an honest review."
Kindle_Store_5,1.0,OR,This story line had a lot of promise then crashed and burned out very quickly in the end .the one mindedness of the main character is a completely ridiculous and the lack of  insight is just plain stupidity .

What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review.

The litter itself is ok. It doesn't really absorb the cat urine so I try to scoop that out when I clean their box.

Both are short introductions to the character and explain why she decided to give up her profession to be a cop. Both are only 45-47 pages, yet both have a good deal packed into a short space. Each short stands alone as Mr. Dugoni carries a separate plot in each. Together, they make for a novel and complete introduction to the main and supporting characters. ""Academy"" should be read first, then ""Third Watch."

My only problem is that the mirror part really is very easy to scratch.  It warned not to put anything metal in it so that it won't scratch, but of course I did (a ring, some earings) so that was my fault.  But I've had it for two days, and it scratched really quickly.  Not major scratches though, just little tiny ones.  Overall, it's a great product."

He loves it and is still having fun with it.  It is a great toy and I would recommend it to any child who is interested in learning about animals.My son loves it.We bought this for our grandson. He loves it. He uses it to play with his little brother.  He's very happy with it.We bought this for our 3 year old. She LOVES it. She loves it. It is a fun little toy for her and we love to play it with her. She plays with it for about an hour. It is a little hard to pull it down as she is a little too young for it. It is hard to lift it down and it doesn't fit. It has a lot of pieces and it is hard to see all the pieces in the house. She loves to push the blocks down and move them around. It is hard to put it back on. It is very small so it is not very big. It is very soft and nice quality. It is a good size and it is a good size for little hands. It is a good size for a 4 year old.This was a gift for my son for Christmas. He loves it. He also plays with it a lot and plays with it for hours

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,CG,"So I read the review and thought I would give it a try.

The first book in the series was the prequel, Prequel 2, and I'm a fan. The story was well told and the characters were well developed. I love how the author wrote the descriptions of the characters. I liked the fact that they were all over the place. There was also the fact that the author had to use a lot of language. It was like a well written story.

I liked the fact that the author used a lot of words and it made the story more realistic. I think that the author would have used some of the things that could have been used for a different story.

I liked the fact that the author kept the main character's name and family name. I also liked that the author used a lot of slang.

The story was good. I really enjoyed the story.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read."

While it is highly repetitive (""People do not buy WHAT you do, they buy HOW you do it"" is said at least a dozen times), the actual message is really interesting and something I should apply to my life every day (aka Gladwell).

A lot of the examples are quite interesting and this is certainly worth the price. As a recent college hire that works as an analyst, I now try to approach all of my analysis asking myself ""why am I doing this?"" and ""how can I accomplish it?"""

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"I received The Skeleton Garden from Netgalley, Alibi, and the Chatterbox program in exchange for an honest review.

The Skeleton Garden is the 4th book in a series about a gardener who seems to have bad things, i.e. bodies, turning up around her. And in this book there are actually a few. Pru, the main character is a gardener working with her older brother on the large garden of an English home, when they start digging up the yard to find out why a tree didn't grow, they come across a WWII plane and a skeleton. Not much later in the same hole another body appears and the town is excited to find out who committed the crime or if it was an accident.

This book had a very slow start, I have not read the first books in the series, so I really didn't have enough background about the characters to really feel for them - and even through the book, didn't really feel for them either. So it was hard to read. Yes the book picked up when the bodies started appearing and the investigations started but overall I was not feeling it.

I love a good mystery and this book did provide a few, which was nice, but not having connected with the characters I felt that something was missing for me. But like I said if you read the other books in the series, that may add to the connection with the characters that I did not have."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"There are many hoof supplements and they tend to have very similar ingredients, but do vary.  This means that depending on exactly why your horse doesnt have top quality hooves, different supplements may work better for your particular horse.  Or, of course, if your horses hooves are of poor quality for a reason not related to nutrition, supplements may do nothing at all.

B vitamins, particularly biotin folic acid and Bs are important for the hoof.  According to the guaranteed analysis, this supplement only has biotin.  It does offer a high level of this, at 25 mg per serving.

Zinc and copper are the mineral supplements most likely to help hooves and this supplement offers them both.

A deficiency of particular amino acids can cause problems with the hooves.  The white line can deteriorate if there is a deficiency of methionine.  This supplement is high in protein and does offer methionine.  However, several other hoof supplements offer more methionine, so if your horse has issues with his white line, take a look at Hooflex Hoof Builder or Farriers Formula Double Strength.

Hooves need both omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids and this offers both, though twice as much 6 and 3, so this isn't the greatest supplement for omega-3 fatty acids, though you can buy those as a separate supplement.

Nearly all of the nutrients important to hoof health are also important to coat quality, so if your horse is lacking in both it is quite likely that a hoof supplement such as Horseshoers Secret Extra Strength will help.  If this one doesnt do the job, look for another that offers different hoof-related nutrition  perhaps one with more omega-3 fatty acides, more B vitamins, or a different mix of amino acids.

There is no one best hoof supplement, because what the horse is eating for the rest of his nutrition is such a big factor.  However, for most horses showing less than idea hoof quality, this is a reasonable starting point to see how they respond."

I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"i was skeptical of this movie at first,for two reason reasons. number one is that it is a remake of an Asian film,which usually doesn't bode well. number two is that it seems we have been flooded with movies of this genre the last few years. neither my friend nor i had seen the original,and it would cost us nothing but our time,so we thought,what the heck,let's give it a shot. turns out it wasn't half bad,once it got going,just after the 40 minute mark. from that point on,things start happening,and a good little mystery begins to develop. Elizabeth Banks,who is a very good comedic actress,shows some great dramatic ability here. i would have given this movie a 4 if it hadn't taken so long to get going."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"The Sweetest Taboo by author Harper Miller, is a stunning debut BDSM novel depicting a BWWM D/s interracial romance. Rick and micah's relationship is neither unrealistic to the lifestyle, nor is it unrealistic to a fairytale or whirlwind romance you might hear about over brunch with your friends  and author Harper Miller's deft turn with the pin (mesmeric, though?) is certainly a refreshing addition to the IR/MC genre. Specifically, I really appreciate the intense amount of effort that went into both the packaging as well as the research  the cover is stunning (I want to be micah, and I want to be with Rick) and the very skillful editing. No spoilers here, but I hope that this author has an extremely bright future, and I look forward to reading many, many more of her books. Great craft!

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I got this for toting my work laptop back and forth, and it is perfect, most especially for the price. There were no noticeable finishing issues.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell. The straps and the size of the pack are somewhat unwieldy- I'm 5'3"" and hover around 125 lbs depending on recent pasta/beer/pie intake.

I've read some complaints about the Tannin color- a dark red wine color. It's a traditionally 'feminine' color (whatever that means) - don't buy it if you don't wearing things that are the color of cabernet sauvignon/merlot/syrah and do buy it if you do."

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the cover is a little tight. The case is made of metal and it is not waterproof so it will be hard to hold on to.

I would suggest looking at a larger case for a similar size.

If you are planning to use this case for a new Macbook Air, you should get one with a good screen protector.

UPDATE: I purchased a new version of this case, which I haven't had a chance to use yet.  It is definitely better than the one I purchased.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Be aware that there are only three Melies shorts on this disk and only one of them is in color. A Trip to the Moon is on the disk twice, once in color and again in B&W. There is a choice of two excellent  musical tracks on the B&W films, but the color film only has one soundtrack. It is completely unidiomatic, has distracting mumbling voices, and it doesn't follow the action of the film. Worse yet, it omits Melies's own narration that is supposed to be part of the film.  Nothing makes sense without it. The cheezy synth music sounds like the loopy soundtrack to a 1970s mutton chop midget porn movie. The film is best watched with the volume turned down. The rest of the disk is filled out with a feature length documentary which is interesting, but I can't imagine watching it more than once.

For a little more money you can get a five disk Flicker Alley DVD collection of Melies with dozens of great films, many of which are in even more beautiful color than this one. I'd recommend getting that instead. Search ""melies flicker alley"" and you'll find it. There is a supplement DVD that completes the set too. The DVDs actually look better than the color version here."

When set to the most sensitive setting, the lights were picking up passing cars on the street, so I had to use the mid-range setting, which detects moving objects on my property but not in the street.

Books_5,4.0,CG,"Who wouldnt want to get into a book with a third person perspective. The premise of the story is that the publisher, a former publisher, is planning to publish a novel by a young author. It will be a short story about two teenage girls who are attacked in a bar by a man who is trying to kill them. The story starts with a young girl sitting in a bar and a man who seems to be an alcoholic. The story goes on and on about the man's behavior and how the girl has developed relationships with him and with his friends. When the story ends, the book is over and the next chapter is over. It is a fun story and I would recommend this book to any young person. I have read several of the other stories in this series and I have enjoyed them all. I have never read any of the other books in the series and I have not read any of the other stories in this series. This book is very interesting and I would recommend it to anyone.

It was not the best of the bunch. I think the fact that it was not filmed in a location that I thought was a good location was a good thing.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this bag in truffle which is a dark grayish color with a bright pink/coral inner liner color,  I wanted a convertible bag family vacations and the safety features made this the perfect bag for that.  Bag is roomy and will hold all the stuff I need to carry around when we are out and about on vacation.  The 2 side pockets and the top pocket all lock the front two pockets do not lock but they are great for non value things that you need to grab quickly.  The locking clips are a little hard to do at first but once you figure them out it's not a problem.
The main reason I selected a convertible bag is I wanted something that is a backpack for being hands free or it can be switched to a crossbody bag for going into a museum or a place that you can't have a backpack.
My only dislike about this bag is the handle strap across the top.  It looks really weird because it sticks out several inches making it look strange when it's on your back & it actually makes it a little unsafe when you have it on since it would be very easy for someone could grab it and pull you over with it.  I took a seam ripper and took it off (you can't cut it because the metal that runs through it to make it slash/cut proof) and I will just use the metal hoops for the strap when I use it as a crossbody bag.  Looks much better without the top strap.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and look forward to using it for many future trips and outings!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"For this price, wasn't expecting much.  I wg 140 & 5'4. Put on wgt lately, but have flat belly, hold wgt in legs & butt.  I wanted something loose-ish to sleep in, bought lgt gray, not usually forgiving color. I thought these not only fit perfect but also look cute enough to wear out. They are about mid-rise, with wide waistband. You could pull it down for a lower rise pant. I haven't actually worn them, I know people say drawstring is decorative only.  I could have even gone small, so for skinny people these could be too loose. I was pleasantly  surprised w pant and It's a forgiving style. Of course this is just my opinion everyone has different shapes. Hope this helps
  REVISION;  Ok have to revise my feedback. I washed these pants, shrank 1full size, no longer forgiving color , no longer cute. They didn't soften up in wash, they were stiff, but I thought they pressed them. They are 90%cotton. These pants are now just OK , I'll wear 4 sleeping only but nt even soft. Price is inexpensive and I if ur thin lighter colors should look fine. Any extra curve  recommend darker color and order up. They will shrink. I wear a 6 ladies and 9 juniors . Hope this was helpful. Of course this is just my experience"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I have kinda a love/hate relationship with these flashlights. I love that they are super affordable and you get three flashlights. They are plastic, not aluminum, but the tolerances seem tight and they appear relatively water resistant. I left the floodlight on last night and after 4-1/2 hours the light intensity was down to about 25%, but still usable.

The non-focusing flashlight produces a tight, bright beam that easily illuminates objects 50-75 feet away. The light bar floodlight works great for close up work or will light half a room bright enough to read. The rubberized flat black exterior is nice and ""grippy."" The magnet is sufficient to hold the light vertically or horizontally on smooth sheet metal.

Ugly? Oh, man I so wish they provided directions on how to open these suckers up to insert the batteries! (3 AAA--not included) TIP: half the textured base near the magnet (opposite the on/off switch) slides open. There is a faint black arrow at the opening.

The bad? These lights have three settings--flashlight, floodlight and flashing red LED lights. Two of my flashlights worked perfectly, but the flashing red LED's never worked on the third. No biggie and I'm keeping them all, but it bodes ill for the reliability.

Still, these things are so cheap I can't complain--much.
___________________________________

UPDATE--that third flashlight with the non-operational red LED's? It drained the batteries flat while turned off! Obviously a bad circuit. I threw it away. A 33% failure rate is nothing to brag about."

I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING...

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Wonderboys is an artsy film. It is about as far from the mainstream as you can get. Homosexuality, dead dog in the trunk, marijuana/alcohol abuse: such subject matter makes WB decidedly NOT a family or date movie. Not one you would watch with your mom. Wonderboys is best watched with open-minded friends or alone at night after a weird day. Masterful performances by Michael Douglas, Tobey Maguire, and Robert Downey, Jr.

 Michael Douglas is a college writing professor at a small school in Pennsylvania. He is having an affair with the chancellor's wife, and his second novel is either stalled or out of control. Enter James, his oddball class prodigy. Played by Maguire, James' pale face and helpless demeanor leads Douglas to take him under his wing. But instead of providing fatherly guidance, Douglas and his editor pal Robert Downey Jr. lead James on lots of frat-boy hijinks.

 Wonderboys will especially be appreciated by anyone who is a writer. The film will leave you with a thoughtful smile."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Fallen Dragon"" is an awesome sci-fi novel by an incredible talent in the genre.  Some of these reviews compare the novel unfavorably to Hamilton's ""Night's Dawn"" trilogy, but I think it's rather better:  while ND is an epic space opera which draws strength from both its exploration of posthuman themes and grand drama on a cosmic scale, Fallen Dragon's strength is in its focus on characters and a far more mature style than was evident in ND.  Fallen Dragon basically focuses on three characters and their involvement in the travails surrounding a particular colony world (though these events have implications for all human society, one eventually discovers), and this focus helps to create a strong storyline and character development that really matters to the reader."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Received this book as ARC from NetGalley for review.
Rose Harbor in Bloom (Rose Harbor #2).
The Inn at Rose Harbor (Rose Harbor #1).

A great addition to Debbie Macomber's easy reading novels about family and friendships in a small town.
This new addition is a spin-off of sorts from her hugely popular Cedar Cove series which is now televised on Hallmark Channel. The characters at Rose Harbor are as friendly and hospitable as their neighbors in Cedar Cove. The setting revolves around a newly widowed woman who pours all her energy into the Inn which she was supposed to run with her husband. The interesting characters who come by for a visit are sure to delight.

In the second book, Jo Marie continues putting the final touches on the Inn with help from a handyman who doesn't like to talk about himself much. Although she finds him incorrigible at times, they seem to enjoy each other's company. A friendship appears to be in bloom at Rose Harbor Inn."

I can use the mini with a USB charger in it for charging or charging with my iPad.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This came just in time to try! My daughter and I just baked a cake for my husband's birthday and the door bell rang with this delivery! I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty

This book tells the story of three women:  Rachel, Cecilia and Tess, and how they are connected in ways that are unknown even to them. Rachel's daughter was murdered as a teenager. Cecilia is feeling unsatisfied with her normally perfect life as wife and mother. Tess's husband has fallen in love with her cousin, so she packs up her young son and goes back home to her mother's. All three women are dealing with tons of issues, to varying degrees of success. These women are interesting and complex. There is a decent mystery plot to this book to keep readers engaged. At times this book is a tad predictable but that did not take away enjoyment from reading it. I liked Moriarty's book What Alice Forgot so I chose this one from Amazon Vine to review. I was not disappointed. I enjoy her writing style; it is easy and enjoyable to read without being fluff. Moriarty creates interesting characters that will keep readers hooked in her books.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"These are neither a good nor a bad glove; you just need to understand what you're ordering.  This is not a warm glove; it is a LINER, and a very thin, open weave liner at that.  You can see your hand through the loose weave, so you wouldn't wear these for principal cold weather protection for your hands.  They fit nicely and are comfortable with good finger length, and the biosensors work well on touch screens, although I don't understand why OR put biosensors only on the thumb and index fingers instead of on all the finger tips.  The glove is very flimsy and subject to pulls, runs, and catching on things, so I would not think them durable at all.  They also have scratchy tags sewn into the insides at the wrists, which tags are annoying and look difficult to remove.  Mine did not come with the clips shown in the photo (on Amazon) that hold the gloves together when not in use.  These gloves made me think about which fingers I use on my touchscreen, and I realized that I use more than just my thumbs and forefingers (I regularly use my middle finger) so for me this glove does not have enough biosensor tips.

It's a suspenseful, futuristic (year 2177) sci-fi tale in which a junior astrophysics student spots an unidentifiable object flying towards our solar system.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Review of Secondhand Lions
Hot Toasty Rag, November 29, 2017

Usually, in this formula of coming-of-age films, its a troubled young girl who gets sent to her grandmothers house, ultimately learns the errors of her ways, and becomes a better person. In Secondhand Lions, Haley Joel Osment gets sent to his great-uncles farm. This type of squeaky-clean, goody-goody story is usually watched by women, which is why they usually star women. The added testosterone of three men in the lead roles made the film feel a little strange. Tim McCanliess script tried to add a masculine plot line about finding a hidden stash of gold, but it was a storyline that didn't really appeal to women. All in all, the film doesnt really work.

Michael Caine and Robert Duvall play Haleys great-uncles, and the real problem with the film is spoken by the latters character. He says, in teaching a life lesson to his nephew, that he believes all people are genuinely good. The reason this line of dialogue doesnt resonate is the same reason the rest of the film doesnt work: its not speaking to the right audience. If a grandmother character said that line to her granddaughter, the women in the audience would feel warm and fuzzy inside and the movie would have been a hit. Women, especially in this genre of films, have a special close-knit circle of girl power that would make that line believable. Men face disappointments as soon as they are old enough to chase after their dreams; they live through daily struggles, internal frustrations, and never-ending regrets. I cant imagine a man of Robert Duvalls age truly believing that all people are good."

I love that there was a scene with the heroine, Daisy, on a train with a group of people. I love that the heroine is a woman, but I felt like she was a little too small for her size.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Listen - we know we are not alone when we say reality TV has hi-jacked network and cable television and most of it isn't really a positive force in life with its usual focus being on the nastier side of the human condition (fighting, jealousy, lying, cheating, etc. etc.) and at some point we have simply given up - so what to do after?  We became our own T.V. station!

We stopped paying the cable company hundreds and hundreds of dollars for programming we don't like (because complaining about modern television is about as helpful as peeing up hill) and we channeled that money into DVD/Blu Ray purchases of shows we know we love and this one was one the list!

Green Acres is the story of a New York lawyer who has always dreamed of owning/operating a farm - a true pioneer in the 'Back to the Land' movement (John Denver would have been proud).  But not everything is what it seems when Mr. Haney sells him a piece of useless land, a broken down house, an 'antique' tractor, and everything else one might need.  When Mr. Douglas seems too starry eyed and naive to notice his high society wife is only too happy to point out the problems.  What happens next is anyone's guess in this zany half hour comedy which we can't seem to stop watching  (even our teen daughter).  CBS made a total miss-step when it canceled this show as part of their not-so-bright cultural war against country themed shows in the so called ""rural purge"" of 1971 - at least we got 170 episodes (over many seasons) to remember it by."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Josh Anvil and the Pivotal Weapon by Bruce Arrington is a YA fantasy about the fourteen-year-old Josh and his heroic adventures outwitting the evil alien Raga and saving Earth from invasion.

Joshs human friend Troy accompanies him, along with Anton, a humanoid alien slave from another world. They meet up with more of Antons people, plus a helpful renegade alien, along the way.

This is the second adventure about Josh and his friends, and this time our hero has mind melded with an intelligent power that guides him into rescuing Antons son and a remarkable young woman who can split planets. Our hero pilots an organic spaceship made from a tree. It replicates Joshs favorite meals (fast food tacos and barbeque pizzas) and conjures cool teen clothes (jeans and t-shirts with snappy sayings).

Mixed in with the fun romp, the story examines more serious themes about Joshs loyalty, not only to his close friends, but also to the welfare of Earth. Our hero struggles with the consequences of rash and revengeful actions. The end of the story is a satisfying conclusion to the current set of adventures, and sets the stage for more fun to come in the sequel. For fans of YA fantasy adventures about a teenage boy, this story is a recommended read.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.

A couple of scenes are quite gruesome, especially the scene with the still-standing woman with the bullet in her neck."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,Not for the faint of heart. The story is a good one. There is a strong female lead and an interesting plot. I liked how the main characters were not so much strong as they were. I found myself in situations where I was thinking about the man who was the hero. I felt a bit lost with the heroine and I felt the need to bring up the idea of the heroine

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I was shocked and appaIlled at the terrible story of the the evil son of the equally evil Saddam . The movie is a glimpse into the life of a man whose complete lack of moral conscience and humanity allowed him to do anything he desired without fear of retribution. The double, however, is a man who is appalled at the atrocities he's forced to witness and takes a daring step to get some justice for the lives Saddam's son destroyed. If you were as unaware of this story as I was, it will enlighten and perhaps enrage you but you will not fail to be moved!"

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"I'd tried flying helis years ago and didn't have a great experience. I was not interested in spending a majority of my time fixing things when I would have rather been out flying. This little guy flew great out of the box. I will say however that you need to make sure you check this heli out before flying it. I found a blade grip screw that needed a little tightening and one of the pitch rod links was out of its slot on the rotor head. As with any heli, it should always be checked out before its first flight and never assumed the manufacturer has done everything correctly out of the box.

The V977 is responsive and does what you ask of it. Sure its a little quirky. You constantly have to be mindful of the throttle and it doesn't take much wind to blow this guy around. Now granted I've only flown in 6G mode and I'm more of a beginner/intermediate pilot. This is a great heli for taking to the park and practicing hovering in all orientations, pirouettes, circles and figure eights. I can't speak for 3D as I don't know how to yet. The manual is of course written in Chinglish. I had to get most of the instructions from youtube vids. Just make sure your throttle hold is off, your idle up is off and throttle stick all the down before turning on the tx - the rest you can get from youtube.

Make note this is not a throw away heli after a couple of flights, otherwise known as an Airhog or something similar. You can actually buy spare parts for this guy. However, ironic as it is, the heli does take quite a beating. I highly recommend someone new to the RC Heli hobby start with this particular copter, or just stick to micro helis starting out. Get a lot of practice on a sim (FS One, Phoenix, Real Flight, Accu-Sim, X-Heli or whatever), and then take what you learned outdoors without having to worry about dumping an expensive first helicopter."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"I started watching this series on a whim after seeing a few episodes on my TV. I just wanted to see how the series would be played. The basic premise of the show is that a young girl is kidnapped by a gang of drug dealers. She is brought to the scene and is put in a cell.

I found it entertaining and I loved it. I've seen all of the movies and I liked the first one a lot. The second one was a bit of a disappointment. I wanted to see how the series would be played, but I was disappointed. I didn't even know it was a series until I watched it on a weekend. I'm glad I did, but I still have to see it again. I loved it, and I'll buy it again. I was a little disappointed, but it was fun to watch. I'll see it again. I love the characters and the plot.This is a movie that I enjoyed watching over and over.  It's very funny and good acting.  The acting was good and the movie is well written.  I would recommend this movie.I am a huge fan of the series and I loved this series.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,Book #2 was a must read. The characters were well developed and kept my interest. I recommend this book. I had a lot of fun with this book.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,Love these wipes!  My dog has been using them for a month now and they smell great!  I have not had any issues with fleas but the spray does not take up much of the smell. It does not clump on the carpet as I expected. The only thing I would say about these is that they are a bit big for a dog that is a bit small for a puppy. I like the fact that they are not all that hard to put on and it is easy to clean. The only thing I would say is that I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a long lasting brush.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I don't now about the rest of you, but it certainly seems like a drawer full of clothes, kitchen towels, socks, underwear, etc. takes on its own odor after a time. This little bags take that smell out within about a week! Amazing and successful. I prefer using natural unscented products for cleaning, bathing, laundry, etc., and these little gems definitely fill the bill for destroying annoying odors. Another plus with these are they can be ""recharged"" just by placing them in the sun for the prescribed time."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"If you're a fan of Inkheart and of science fiction or alternate reality, this is the perfect for you. In this alternated world in 1985 in Britain, time travel is routine, cloning is a reality (dodos have been resurrected,) and literature is taken very seriously. People can get lost in poems and stories, and first editions are forged. This is all usual for Thursday Next, a literary detective. But then someone begins kidnapping characters from stories. And when Jane Eyre is kidnapped, Thursday has to track down the villain and go into the novel herself. This is a really great book; playful and wonderful. I loved the world-building in the book, though there were a lot of specialized terms that you had to learn to make sense of the story. Also, I really liked the character of the villain, Acheron Hades. He was so deliciously evil. And seemingly invincible. Fforde's writing style was really great too; you know, that British style. It was straightforward but also had dry humor. And action, but not too much action. Fforde is actually from Wales, I think. This is the first book in the Thursday Next series, which includes Lost in a Good Book, The Well of Lost Plots, and Something Rotten. *You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, novareviews. blogspot."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,The lithium-ion battery allows this to run a long time on a charge. There is however one flaw that hopefully B&D can address. The filter attachment can be confusing to some and the filter may become unattached at which point the motor is sucking in the dirt. A redesign where filter is attached directly to motor housing with positive and fool proof installation would solve this problem. Other than this problem a really great product.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Our family loves playing games, but no one was looking forward to playing Candyland over-and-over again when our grandson was ready to play games. ""Monkeying Around"" seemed as if it might be an excellent alternative.  The adults in our family who play games and, most importantly, the little ones think ""Monkeying Around"" is a winner. It is sturdy, colorful, and delights our grandson when the monkeys topple the tree. The game is challenging enough for adults - determining balance and distribution of the monkeys - so that they are not adverse to playing this game with the little ones in your household.

""Monkeying Around"" seems to be durable and able to take enthusiastic toddler play. The monkeys are plastic and will not break; we keep them in a Ziploc sandwich bag ton prevent losing them. If the game structure is dropped, the tree trunk which is made of hard plastic could possibly break, so we do put the assembled tree out of reach when not in use. The spinner is probably the weakest aspect of ""Monkeying Around"" - it does not spin particularly easily. A better option would have been an arrow-shaped spinner attached to a cardboard square with the numbers and large monkey printed in the different segments.

Players will learn to make decisions when each must decide where monkeys should be hung.  Little ones learn there are consequences for choosing to incorrectly place the monkey. Further, the game teaches a child to think about balance and weight distribution when deciding where the monkeys are to be hung.

""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way to introduce games to a child. The recommended age range of 4 and up is probably appropriate; at 3, a toddler may not fully understand taking turns.  However, ""Monkeying Around"" is an excellent way for a child to begin understanding that concept."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors."

He gives the inside story about teaching English in Chile by connecting his own personal knowledge of how English teaching has been developing in Chile over the past 14 years. The results of four international tests have never been wonderful, but the inside story is that English in Chile is changing the way it teaches English. The author argues that Chile could produce its own National English test, with four skills, give that test every 3 years, and have better test data to fine tune the way English is taught in Chile. I like the way he understands that the test results need to be understood as a way to keep improving teaching. It is a fascinating book for anybody who is interested in teaching or learning English."

This is a very well written story.  I am looking forward to reading more from this author.I loved this book. I was hooked from the very beginning. I loved it. I can't wait to read the next book in the series. I'm on my way to reading the next book.I read this book in one sitting, and I absolutely loved it! I was so excited to read this story. The characters were real, and the story flowed perfectly. I could not put it down, and I loved it! I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to see what happens next! I highly recommend this book to everyone!This was a great book. I love the fact"
Books_5,2.0,CG,"I think that it should be an easy read, and I will admit that I have been tempted to finish it. The book is a bit long, and the cover is very large. It is hard to get into without a bit of research."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I purchase  it for my neice and she absolutely  love it and that's  what  count
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,Ok I say again WHO is writing these reviews. For $89 this is a total rip off. The candle holders are made of pressed aluminum. The stand is Saturday and in 3 screw together pieces. It's painted a fake gold or bronze color. I hope that Amazon puts a stop to these customer reviews that are false and miss leading. Had the price been $29.99 then it would be a great value.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,Save $ on these instead of the original shipping box. I will keep my money!Very pretty.
Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,The ball didn't last five minutes however we still have the stick.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"We got the medium for our beagle. He loves it. The only problem is, it's either too easy or too hard to get out. Either you put something big in and he just can't get it out, or you put something small and it comes right out.

So I started putting some peanut butter in it, it keeps him entertained for a few minutes. He's not a very playful dog, he won't taste the ball he won't play with toys. So this gets him to be a little bit more active, which we love.

Of course once he has the tree, he has absolutely no interest in it after that. I wish it was a little bit easier for him to get a bigger treat, or harder to get a smaller one."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Cute, functional, and fits easily in my car. I have two of these Sherpas. My dogs seem to prefer traveling in these versus a larger crate in my car. These bags must be comfortable for 10 pound dogs, because my dogs were very quiet and calm while riding in them for six hours. No whining, crying, or Benedryl....  These bags are very easy to carry, very easy to load the dog into, and appear to be well made. The purple color is crazy cute, too."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Great lead for the dog. My dog is small - less than 13 pounds, and this leash works great. I don't think it would be good for a smaller dog - but would work on a larger dog. It seems to be strong and works fine. Has an extra little hook that keeps it from coming off the halter. I wanted it because my dog loves water and I needed something waterproof. Also, I like that I can just wipe the dirt off."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"This will probably meet your needs if not carrying it around, its quite heavy for its size! I purchased one from Amazon's Warehouse to save a few bus, in truth, it cost me more and is nothing more then a paper weight, as they don't check to see if there's a key in the package! Yes, they sent me one with no key, and expect you to pay to return it....How much common sense does it take to make sure a customer gets the complete package especially when the package is transparent with a place for the key to see in plain view....nope, just grab something off a shelf and throw it in a box and send it! Morons!!!! Isn't even worth the cost to ship it back, so beware.....DO NOT buy a item from amazon warehouse!!!"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is a fun craft kit for girls. The set makes a star shaped decor item whose frame snaps together. This frame is then decorated with the included string as well as little beads and gems that come in the kit. It's a fun kit but it's the all that difficult or involved. An eight year old could easily complete the project without assistance and older girls, over twelve or so, will likely become bored with it or complete the project very quickly. What I like most about the kit is that it doesn't involve glue or anything messy. It's something that can be completed on a car trip."

These are just as billowy as my old medium pairs of Hanes, the crotch seam is way too low, and the price is twice as much as what I paid for my original medium pairs. At this rate boxer-briefs are going to overtake my boxers simply because I can't find a decent fitting pair. I mean heck, these things are practically shorts.

Once in awhile even 4+ star products will let you down."
Books_5,5.0,CG,Could not put it down. I love the way she says it. I think this book is a keeper. The characters are believable and the story is captivating. This is a must read for all of us. I was excited to see how this book would turn out.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Can't beat this for the price. Great looks and great lume to boot!
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"Really clever design. A bit more bulky than the regular version but its still a great product.

I would not recommend this product, unless you're a professional cyclist.

I'm 5'3"" and weigh 180 lbs.  I have long arms and some large legs.  I have a short torso and the chest is a bit big for me.  I like the size and shape of the sleeves and the fact that the material is soft and a little more comfortable.  I have had no problems with the fit.  I'm very pleased with this purchase.

"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This was my first purchase of anything in the ATACS FG pattern and I must say I am very happy with the pattern.

The boonie looks well made out of very good quality made materiel, There are some slight assembly/sewing discrepancies if you look for them but nothing that would affect performance or concealment.

The outer ""utility"" band (the band you stick extra foliage) is made from shiny OD green nylon webbing, which detracts somewhat from the very flat, subdued pattern of the rest of the hat. I wish they could have used flat tan cotton webbing on it, or just doubled over some of the ripstop material that the rest of the hat is made from. It kind of sticks out on it in my own opinion. Not a big issue though, and the only thing I would change about it.

NOTE TO MILITARY PERSONNEL: This hat does NOT meet NIR Specs (Near Infrared Signature Management Technology)

Overall this is a very good buy for the money and I am well pleased with the purchase.

As far as sizing goes I have an old GI tan boonie made by propper that I've worn for years now and has been washed multiple times. It is a size a 7.25 (or 7 1/4) and right now it fits my head like a rubber band, even with only small amount of hair on my head. I considered also getting this boonie in 7.25 as well but chose 7.5 instead. I'm glad I did, 7.5 fits loose on my head but still tight enough to be comfortable. After a couple trips through the washer it will still be comfortable. Some good advice that propper put on the label is:

INITIAL LOOSE FIT REQUIRED FOR CONTINUED COMFORT!

So it's OK if you have a loose fit with it. It will shrink over time. Very happy all around with this purchase."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,I have a sincere love of Lego and this is no exception.  This is a great set.
Books_5,1.0,OR,"I had read Syrup and found it an entertaining satire. This one is just a rehash of old themes. It seems like it was written very quickly. The writing lacks sophistication. And one thing really kept bugging me. In America when one's employment is terminated it is referred to commonly as being ""fired."" The author, who is Austrailian keeps referring to it as ""sacked."" A minor detail, admitedly, but an aggravating one that should have been caught in the editing process."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also."

He loved it.  He has already been playing with it a lot and it seems like he will get some use out of it.  The toy is very light weight and the little pieces are really nice.  The colors are bright and the pieces are very easy to work with.  The only negative is that the pieces are a bit difficult to put together and the pieces are not easy to bend.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought a pair of these to go into a Synology DS213j Network Attached Storage (NAS) unit.  Hard drives don't impress me - they are supposed to work.  However, hard drives DO disappoint me when they fail and I've found that some brands should be avoided regardless of cost.

In my business, I buy more than several 3.5"" and 2.5"" drives a year and the choice is usually WB ""Black"" because they are quiet and reliable.  I chose the ""Red"" this time because they were recommended for use in a NAS.

One month - no issues."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This lap loom is a nice starting point (and perhaps ""enough"" for those who don't wish to upsize) for children and adults who want to learn how to weave. Unlike some other products on the market for weaving, it's made by a loom company and yields a ""genuine"" woven product. The basic premise is to repeatedly go over and under vertical warp threads with a shed stick. One shed stick can stay in the loom at all times (until nearing the end), but on every other pass through, this weaving process must be repeated. Once the shed stick is pulled onto its long edge, every other string rises up, and yarn loaded onto a stick shuttle is passed through, and the stick shuttle lowered. This yarn is beaten down, and the process is repeated. Although the loom has its limitations due to its small size, projects that can be made from such a small loom include a placemat, small doll blanket, pillow, wall-hanging, and purse. Users can also, of course, seam together more than one project to create larger pieces of fabric. The set comes with one project to work on, and the included instruction booklet gives suggestions about what it can be turned into. The included sample project teaches how to do horizontal and vertical stripes. (I never realized how easy vertical stripes would be--you just do every other row with two different colors, and they ""magically"" form!)

Two extra parts are ""missing"" from this set. Although you can use it as is, you may also wish to get:
(1) Wonder Wand (by the same company), which helps speed up the process by pushing down every other warp thread. (2) Tapestry beater for pushing down the yarn. Otherwise, they recommend using a fork. The loom and accessories are unfinished wood. I ended up staining and varnishing them to help seal the wood and keep it looking nice, but this isn't really necessary. One extra suggestion: I find this easiest to work on with legs crossed. Otherwise, it's a bit large to be considered a ""lap loom."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I got these because they look great, like equipment you might find on the spaceship in 2001: A space Odyssey.  I was tempted to keep them just for that. The problem is that I don't like using them.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

If you like Sony, why not check out the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-MDR-770LP-Headphones-Black/dp/B00385XTWA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony MDR-770LP Headphones (Black)</a>&nbsp;for just a few dollars more.

I like this one in particular because it's not as thin a material as other white t-shirt/basic layering shirts can be. Some of us get to an age where we don't need to show off our undergarments for all to see. This shirt helps me do that. It is form fitting. I usually wear Large/10-12. I ordered this in a Large. It is not tight, but it hugs to the body just as the photo shows. Every curve is visible. It makes for a great alternative to a sexy t-shirt style for over 40's.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Taotronics Bike Phone Mount Bicycle Holder is a great peace of engineering, that is very versatile. Prior to buying the phone mount holder I placed my phone in a bum bag, when riding my road bike. The Taotronics phone mount holder has enabled me to change all this. Now my phone is mounted on my handle bars in front of me. During my 40km rides ""DownUnder"" (Sydney, Australia), where at times the ride can get rather bumpy, my phone sits securely clamped and strapped to the phone mount holder on my handle bars. I find it so much easier to use my phone when riding. Also, it is easier to listen to the feedback on my riding performance during my ride, from the downloaded app on my phone. This phone mount was purchased on 15th March 2017 and my wife was so impressed with it, she wanted one for her bike, which was purchased on 25th May 2017. The recommendation from the seller, to use the rubber strap before you put the holder part and the clamp together on the handle bars, was taken heed of. I recommend both the Taotronics Phone Mount Holder and seller Sunvalleytek. Regards Stephen."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Season 6 of Stargate was a disappointment to some because we lose Daniel Jackson for a bit.  The stories continue to be strong, however.  Apparently our actor had a movie deal and left (mostly) for the year.  Still, he makes appearances (being ascended) from time to time and his replacement (an Alien with the ability to learn new things quickly) does a fine job.

Really, the season barely misses a beat.  And while Season 9 and 10 changes our cast radically with RD Anderson leaving the main spot (don't consider any of this spoiler alerts since the show's logo include pictures of the actors involved each year), Season 6 maintains our other characters (as well as Daniel Jackson from time to time) so it gets 5 stars from me. Well done."

Electronics_5,3.0,CG,"The mount is solid and holds a 55"" tv. I will keep this mount in my desk. I bought this for a friend, and he is very happy with the purchase. The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life. The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip. It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it on the first day of the trip. The battery life is good, but it is not the best. It will charge the phone up to about 8 hours, but it does not last very long. I would recommend it for anyone looking to recharge their phone. I have no complaints about this. Works well, and the case is well made. Would buy again. This is a great little speaker for the price. The sound is good. The only complaint I have is that the audio cable seems to break when you push it, which is annoying. The sound quality is not great. I would have preferred a little more bass. Overall, it is a great little speaker. I would recommend it. Very nice. I just wish it had a bit more volume control. I've had a few of these for a few months now, and haven't had any problems. The USB 3. 0 port is a bit flimsy, but that's not a huge problem since the USB 2."

The second one lasted only a month or so.  The malfunction seems to be that, with regular use, the battery no longer makes proper contact resulting in a blank screen or random resets in the clock function.

It's only on the ""grill"" part so if the vendor could replace this piece for me I would gladly revisit my rating.  Photo attached.  It's worse in person because the flash from the camera washes it out a bit.

Update:  Vendor replaced front panel at no cost to me and without hesitation.  Amending review to 5 stars.  I've had the product for over 1 year and it's great.  I even bought a second one but with the USB 3.0 front input.  Both are fantastic.  I highly recommend and will buy more myself."

What a simple and great idea to mark 4, 6 and 8 ounce servings on these wine glasses or any type of beverage such as juice, milk or soda.  The frosted lines discreetly indicate the 4, 6 and 8 ounce mark and it appears to be part of the design of the glass so it is a bit of a subtle reminder that only I would know (that I am tracking my intake of wine/beverage) if I am among a crowd of people.  This comes in a package of 2 wine glasses and they are dishwasher safe.  I really like this product and would recommend this to all my friends and family who are tracking their alcohol intake."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Cheryl Strayed's book is at once lyrical, poetic, concise and brutally honest, much like the trail she hikes.

Though toward the end she seems to lose the charming self-deprecation of the first 2/3 of the book, the way she wraps up the book---what every reader waits for---makes every part of taking her journey worth it, and worth discussing."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Another reviewer wrote about this and I missed it, so here it is again:  If the power is turned off to this unit, it trips.  The other reviewer points out the best or worst case example:  If you plug aquarium equipment into this, and the power goes out, even for a blink, you must press the reset button to restore power to the equipment.  A lamp would be another bad thing to plug into this, since you would have to find and press the reset button to turn the lamp back on.  An alarm clock would be a bad idea for obvious reasons.

If you can live with this constraint (I could), then the good news is that it seems to work in all other respects."
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I found this short history tedious.  I could not immerse myself in it and often found myself putting the book down out of boredom so that it took me much longer to read than many longer histories I've read in the past.

I believe the main problem is that the author condenses too many characters in the space without rounding the characters out; I do not find myself interested in them because they appear wooden...not enough insight into their personalities and not enough color given to their backgrounds.  I feel the author's past as a journalist has influenced her here.  She can write volumes of information, but it doesn't seem to engage the reader on a deeper lever than a newspaper story might.

I enjoy Christopher Hibbert and Alison Weir more.  They convey complex historical events with a gift for giving the reader a feeling for the time and they have an ability to communicate characters on more of a flesh-and-blood level.  Too bad.  I was looking forward to the book."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My 21 month old, 50 pound lab mix needs something to chew on every day. He chews between 30 minutes to one hour daily. Most toys he can destroy in a day or less. This includes the giant ropes! The only chew toys that last are heavy duty Kong toys and these Nylabones. He prefers the nylabones and rarely goes for the Kong toys. I keep two or three different shape and textured nylabones out for him all the time and replace them every 9 to 12 months. That's about how long it takes him to chew it down to about two inches. This regular shaped bone and the wishbone are his favorites over the heavily textured type. I can't tell the difference by smell of the different flavors and he doesn't prefer one flavor over another either. I like these over real bones because he isn't able to chew off a sharp chunk and swallow it. These shred in small bits like sawdust and won't hurt your pet if swallowed. The Dura chews keep my pup content and away from the shoes and furniture so we are both happy campers!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,I bought these boots for my girlfriend and she was very excited to receive such a lovely gift. She loves that they go on so easily and yet they are incredibly secure once they are laced up. They come in a variety of colors but the blue color we chose is a lovely pairing with any type of denim. They are made fairly well and have held up great so far in their use. The pocket on the boots is great too since it provides a place to stash money or a small set of keys when you don't want to or can't put them elsewhere. She states that they are quite comfortable but despite this she still chose to put a set of cushioning insoles in them. She does this with all of her shoes and boots though. She had worn them for the better part of eight hours and was happy with how great her feet felt despite being active for so long. My girlfriend certainly didn't need another set of boots but these ones are worth having. I think they look great on her and she is quite happy with how they look and feel on herself as well.

The Hunt for Eros is slightly different from her previous series, but it will intrigue you from the beginning with its fast paced, fun, sexy, and adventurous plot. This scavenger hunt for a priceless work of art, will have you routing for its rescue. Highly recommended read for those who love a thrill seeking romance.
Jane Andrews has been down on her luck. The pay of a pre school teacher isn't that great. Barely able to survive, her late night call came in just the knick of time. Being summoned to England, Jane finds herself inheriting her great-uncle's estate. However, the worth of it lays in the hands of a so called priceless work of art that she is responsible for finding. Her one and only hope to conquer her quest is to trust a stranger....Mr. Ben Hunt!
High standing Englishman and art guru Ben Hunt has dabbled in a variety of unethical and physically deplorable activities. He is a mastermind of the arts; collectables and sexual, he is well schooled in his knowledge. When the beautiful Jane seeks his help, he battles with his conscious for the first time in his life. As they journey to find the ""Cupid,"" Jane has to beware of who see can trust. Will she see through the lies spoken to complete their task? With the cards stacked against them, will they ever succeed?"
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"These cheater plugs are great. I ended up buying these cheater plugs because I needed a pair of earrings that I can wear daily and won't poke me in the neck or fall out because of a cheap backing. These earrings fit all of my requirements; they have a nice screw-on back and they are identical front and back so no more neck poking. These cheaters do look like the real thing as well. They fit well and I forget I'm wearing them because they are so comfortable. These are made of surgical steel and feel very well made and seem as though they will hold up well over daily use.

It is important to note that the posts on these are larger than the average stud post so you may have to work to get them in the first time around. Normal earring posts are usually 18g these are 16g.

Edit: After being so pleased with these cheaters I went ahead and purchase this same style in the other colors (black, purple, blue, green and the plain silver ones) I love all of them just as much as my this rose gold one. The colors are all true to the pictures and they all are well made. One thing I should mention is the plain silver pair has a slightly longer post than the rest but it doesn't really bother me.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"Amazon saved me a bunch of money on this terrific radar detector.  It will drive you crazy with false alerts unless you disable ""POP Mode"".  Once POP Mode is turned off it stops falsing and it works as well as those $300 dollar (and higher) models.  I have been using it for a while now and it has saved me from many unpleasant experiences.  If you are looking for top of the line detection at under 200 bucks then this is your unit.  Take a look on-line and you will find that this baby has detection capability that rivals the heavy hitters (BEL and Escort)."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My dog absolutely loves this toy. I have ordered two just because the first one was destroyed. I hope this product keeps in stock.

Books_5,2.0,CG,"As SENSE & SENSIBILITY (S&S) is an easy read, and I highly recommend it for everyone!

I read this book in the fall of 1999, when I was a student in college. I was a little skeptical of the value of this book. I was interested in the possibilities of the book, but I was also concerned that it would be marketed as a book for the general public. I was quite surprised to see that the author had written a book with a title like ""The Secrets of Your Life"" which is the subtitle. I felt that it was a little too general in a way that it was not. I think it was a good read.

I did not like the cover of this book. I thought the title of the book was too general and I had no idea what the title meant. It was very misleading. I think the book was very well written and had a very well-developed story. I think it is a good read for the general public.

In addition, while I waited for THE FIRM to fill the backorder for the stove and bundle purchased directly from them, they dropped the price by $30 but did NOT credit or adjust my costs billed to me. Nothing, absolutely silent on all fronts.

Now for the real bad stuff. The firm has no phone number. I created 5 very nice email over a two week period to them to various email addresses I could find. NOT ONE response. I went to Facebook and reached out to their social media host. No replies what so over.

I went to their site and tried to register the products purchased from them, but received no validation check on warranty registration once I thought it was completed.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/BioLite-Wood-Burning-Campstove/dp/B00BQHET9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">BioLite Wood Burning Campstove</a>

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,I already have Dewalt 20V tools and needed to add a drill.  The chuck on this is very smooth and nice for changing bits.  Tightens down easily with out tearing up your hand.  Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).  When they say bare tool they mean bare tool this came in a clear plastic bag.  I will update this rating if my feelings change or I encounter any failures but so far so good.

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"With an ear hook design, it's an impressive soundstage.  The only drawback is the speaker is so small that it's not portable.  The plastic earpieces are very large and bulky.  The only thing I like about this model is the price.  If you have a large ear, it's a great option.  If you have a small ear, you'll probably want to get a second pair.  But if you have a small ear, I'd say that it's worth it for the price.  You can't beat the price, but if you have a small ear, you'll probably want to get a second pair.This is a great product, I use it on my new iPod Touch. I can connect to my iPhone through a wired USB cable. My iPhone also works with the remote. I have no problems with this. I would recommend this product to anyone.Love this thing! I use it to recharge my iPhone. I have a 5G and it works great. I use it on my phone with the radio, so I can take it on my trips.

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Both of my kids love Playmobil. I purchased this firetruck for my son. He loves this toy but also it'll frustrate him.
First of all, the front-window-compartment is very difficult for the kids to take off. The only way, to place a fireman on the drivers-seat is to take off this window-compartment. Second of all, the ladder comes off every time, my kids just touch it. A grown-up has to install it back on the firetruck. I don't know, why Playmobil couldn't come up with a different solution for this, but it's very frustrating for the kids, that it won't stay installed and they can't fix it themselves. The ladder won't stay up plus falls off the truck. The rest of the firetruck seems very sturdy and has bright colors. Love the sound-effects on it. Not too loud."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,I bought this as a Christmas gift for my husband. Unfortunately he already have one of the same model - which he did not like much.

So if you buy this only do it if you are certain that is what you want.
Books_5,4.0,CG,"Judith Kriger's ""Animated Realism"" really helps me understand the relationship between two women. The first couple of pages are about the two people, both of whom have a shared interest in religion and politics. They both have been in the same boat for years. This book is a great introduction to the two women. The second book, ""The Metamorphosis,"" is about the two women, both of whom have been married for 40 years. Both of whom have been very interested in religion and politics. They both have been very interested in politics, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I like that the women have been in love for 40 years. They both have been married for 40 years, and they both have been very interested in their marriage. I think this book should be a little more of a look at the history of marriage. This is a great book."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"After watching  a couple episodes of ""An Idiot Abroad,"" I had trouble sleeping because of the suffering of this man.  The look on his face as he looked up at his would be captors showed a level of fear, confusion and pain which I found to be unbearable to see.  Having watched ""Extras,"" it seemed impossible to believe that Ricky Gervais would deliberately cause a person to be sick, hungry, sleepless and afraid.
  At the beginning of the episode where Karl is in China, Karl says ""is he havin a laugh? and I thought that perhaps Gervais, Merchant and Pilkington are `avin a laugh"" on us and that this was a deliberate reference to ""Extras."".  I hope that is the case.  This would mean that the viewers are shown to be the sadists that those who made the show suspected they would be.  I also began to doubt that Karl is the childlike person he is portrayed as being because although childlike people say funny things at times, they tend not so say funny things continuously. Also, Karl Pilkington makes no funny comments about a man whose face is deformed.  Perhaps Karl Pilkington is a very clever man who is good at keeping a straight face."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Desert Of Souls is the highly recommended first novel of an Arabian Nights-style series by the new author, Howard Andrew Jones.  As many other reviewers have already somewhat detailed the storyline, suffice it to say it relates the adventures of a scholar and the captain of the guard of a member in the government of Caliph Haroun al-Rashid as they go in search of a powerful magical tablet.  Being chased by an evil spy and a Magi, they encounter a lost city in the desert, a djinn, a desert of actual souls (hence, the title), and other beings and objects, natural and magical.

It's written in the style of the Arabian Nights but with an emphasis on the action-adventure of a sword-and-sorcery tale.  The author also conjures up new magical creations and beings not found in the typical Arabian Nights tale.

I'm anxiously looking forward to the next book in the exciting tales of the two intrepid heroes as they adventure across the Arabian Nights-style world of Howard Andrew Jones."

Books_5,4.0,CG,Very interesting book. I recommend it highly. I've read all of her books and just can't get enough of her stories. This is the first of the three I've read by this author and she has a way of putting it down. I recommend it highly. I love a book that starts with the most beautiful idea and then lets you think about how you could accomplish it. This book is a must read for any creative mind. I would recommend it to anyone who is into music. I enjoyed this book. It was a little confusing at times but it was well written. I really enjoyed the characters and the story. It was interesting to see how the two different families formed. I loved how the family was represented and how it was connected. I enjoyed the history of the family and how it was different. I liked how the author used the example of a priest from a different family to explain the family. I enjoyed the stories and the characters and the story. I liked the historical background of the family and how it was connected. It was a great read. I was very impressed with this book.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"On the one hand, this one is a ""designer"" teddy bear, complete with Swarovski eyes, nose, silver heart and silver banner; on the other hand, it's the softest bear you'd ever lay your hands on if the recipient allowed it.  I was curious about the hour-long video about the history of the Care Bears as well as the cartoon that has been rediscovered and restored for the first time in several decades.  But my 3-year-old grand-daughter had other things in mind than watching historical, or history-making, movies.  This Care Bear proved the right companion to get her to bed and end her pestering us for more presents.  In short, this aristocratic but convivial Barney might be just as appropriate for a bear-deprived, discerning and appreciative adult as a child.  It would probably even make a bear-lover out of Stephen Colbert.  Now I'm wishing I'd secretly bought this classy if not classic bear for myself and purchased the less expensive purple Care Bear for my grand-daughter who, none the wiser, would have been none the less content."

The kids have so much fun chasing each other through this. I love that it stores flat and takes up no space which is great if you live in a small house or apt. I sometimes put those crawl tunnels through it as well, which is another great thing that stores flat. It's easy to put up and take down. Tons of imaginative play!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"Came in the mail really fast! 2 days time. Very good quality made ring. The brushed tungsten is darker than what the product photo shows, but still an attractive ring. My fiance' bought this as my wedding ring since we are on a budget, but again, it's very quality material & I'm very content with this purchase 

My ring finger was fitted as a 14 at some Jewelry Stores. I even had the chance to handle all the ring size rings myself to check it out, to find that perfect fit. 14 seemed to do the job. This ring does fit a tad bigger than what I was fitted for, so I would suggest you go down .5 of a size to ensure perfect fit. It's summer time here in Ohio & our fingers swell up in warmer weather, so the ring is secure enough not to fall off for now. But as soon as fall & winter arrive, I know I will have to purchase a 13.5 in a couple months so I can wear a ring in colder weather. But that's okay however, since the ring only cost the low price of $24, it won't even be an issue!

I hope my review helps someone in their decision making? There were other reviews specifically talking about the size offness, & with my confirmation, they were correct. Just buy one a half size smaller to match true fit!

God bless you all & may peace be upon you! I humbly ask for your prayers as I'm entering into Holy Matrimony here in 3 more days for a peaceful marriage, life longevity & happiness 

P.S.

The reason I gave it only 4 Stars was due to the fact the brushed Tungsten is darker than the picture shows & the half size differ that I & many others are talking about"

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that.

It is very small, which is nice. It does not look like it will last very long, but it does look like it will last a long time. It is very light and very well made.

It is very easy to install, so you can take it on a long bike ride. It is a little heavy for my liking, but it is a nice small tool to have in your pocket.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen. Thanks for a great product."

Well if you look below and see Sony's response.... what a lame reply.
I like how the comment is just ""sorry"".....  why wouldn't the organization try to make it right?
Your smart response would have been to say ""email me and I will send you a lens cap"".
Or "" here is what you can buy on Amazon that fits"".
Hey Sony.... now you really blew it....now everyone can see how stinky your ""after purchase"" customer service is.... sheesh, what a joke.
And you can be sure I will share this story with everyone I can......

Original Review:
Well I have had this camera for 1.5 years and have to say it takes amazing pictures.
It's a nice step up from some of the other point/shoot brands and it is a perfect size to grab and take with anywhere.
Fits well into small bags, purses etc

Here is my sole complaint but it is huge one.....
There is zero info on the lens size so finding a replacement lens cap.... has been a nightmare...... sigh!!
I wasted tons of time talking to the ""product experts"" at Sony (they're not very bright about their own products) who cannot find the lens size.
Tried a few camera stores and not had any luck finding a replacement cover b/c the lens is not threaded....
That means I have to order one from Sony, pay their ridiculously high price for a new lens cap.
What a ""post-purchase"" drag this has been!
Lesson leaned.... I will stick with other brands now that have more main stream camera parts so a simple thing like buying a replacement lens cap is not a big hassle......
You've lost all my future business on this Sony....."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"For Christmas my 11mo old recieved this wheelie bug (in small) and a red Y-Bike.

Preferences can be totally random with these little dudes, but my guy (he's been walking since 8 months, for what it's worth) hardly touches the wheelie bug.

When I do sit him on it, he'll happily accept a push around on it, and then get off.

The Y-bike on the other hand, he gets on by himself and proudly scoots around the house. It's totally adorbs. Y-bike for the win.

Although, since he's my 3rd baby, I can confidently say that, just because he ignores this cute little cow now, doesn't mean it won't be his favorite toy in three months and his Y-bike will be abandoned.

These are just my almost 1 year olds initial reactions to these two items, I am hoping this might help someone decide on their child's first scoot-around."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is the first time I have ever used, or heard of kin+kind products.
This is  all organic nothing in this that could harm my dogs, even if they lick it off..I also put coconut oil
In our dogs food everyday, and that has worked fantastic.

My little indoor dog got a road rash on her tummy when she followed our very large dog that jump up
on a big boulder (we live in the mountains in Ca.) . she missed and slid down. At first we did a Antibiotic cream, but
as its been healing, we then put on kin+kind for her scrape. This seemed to heal her pretty fast.
The big dog is also a indoor dig, but during the spring and summer he gets allergies on his tummy, and turns very red.
I'm  hoping this will solve the problem, as all the creams and meds the Vet has given him does not work.

My son just came back from a camping trip with dryed hands , elbows, & split knuckles from the cold weather, he put this on his hands and 4 days later his hands ect. Are  better.
That said this has a strong scent to it ,but it does not last long. I think the scent is from the Tea Tree oil!

Three sisters return to their childhood home to attend their father's funeral.  Estranged from each other and their father for many years, they are pleasantly surprised at the transformation of the Bed and Breakfast from ramshackle to opulent resort.  They are to inherit this new found wealth ... or are they?  There are conditions, complications, and a good dollop of romance laced with suspense, to say any more would be a giveaway.  It's a page turner good for a quick read under the shade of a tree."

I'm hesitating to open it or keep it in mint condition and buy another one I can actually open. Comes with the little Sylveon figure and 4 booster packs which I found pretty cool.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I heard the author in a workshop that he gave and it really whet my appetite to read the book and try out what he suggests.
I have read countless books on dating, trying to figure out what I have been doing  wrong, how/why I keeping picking/attracting the wrong partners, why there  has been so much resentment, conflict and bitterness in my past  relationships, etc.
After I read the book it all became crystal clear to  me.  I had been considering personality compatibility, but only in a  general way. Neither my partners nor I were ""bad"" people, we were  just the ""wrong"" people for each other.
Dr. Avila's book  enables you to ""type"" yourself, how to quickly size up others for  their ""type"" and my favorite features, WHERE to meet others of  your compatible type and HOW to attract and build relationships with them.  These techniques apply to BOTH opposite AND same sex friendships. Very  targeted, specific information, very rare in dating books.
I realize now  that by following the advice in other dating books, I was hanging out in  the wrong places to meet MY best type.
His theories sound rock solid both  from a psychological and common sense point of view.
I think that his  book settles once and for all the opposites attract, but do they stay  together debate.
Lastly, I commend Dr. Avila for going beyond the theory,  and putting the principles into practice by actually encouraging/helping  set up LoveType social groups. In fact, I am going to his book signing  tonight, to be followed by mingling and discussion of starting up a social  group in the Los Angeles area.  I'm REALLY looking forward to what might  come of it!

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Yes, this is a new writing style for the talented MS EDWARDS.  She has shown more talent than when she wrote as MS NICOLE EDWARDS. And, I didn't know that there ever was that much talent had existed.  Being able to write books that are that good and being that different is phenomenal. We are talking like two completely different people.

The book was great. I'm so excited about this series. And I can't wait for the next book.  This review will have no spoilers as I don't include them.  They can ruin a book if you include them in a review.

The editing was good.
The characterization was more than great.  All the characters had a perfect role they played.  Each of them could have their own unique story.
The storyline was unique and not boring. You are always waiting for the next page.
I gave it a 4.5 stars and then rounded it down. There was one or two chapters that was a little slow. But that was all.

I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK. I URGE YOU TO READ THIS FIRST BOOK OF THE SERIES.  I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND YOU WILL WANT TO CONTINUE WITH THE SERIES.
SO, GET THE BOOK AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

HAPPY READING MY BOOK FRIENDS......."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These Small Tortilla Bowls Makers are a Great Alternative to frying Tortillas by Baking them in the Oven. I use regular size corn tortillas and they look Terrific. I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

Frankly, I find I don't eat anything that requires them:  I eat sushi with chopsticks, and never items that are small or medium nuggets served very hot - hot wings or fried fish straight from the pan, for example.

While the CD is great listening, it's worth buying the DVD [or renting it] to see these songs performed. So much is added to your enjoyment and understanding. It's not Glee and it's not Disney.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My 4-year-old and nearly 2-year-old both love this toy! My 4-year-old loves to make the different bunny houses according to the pictures in the book. It's really boosted her confidence to be figuring things out on her own, plus I feel like it's laying the ground work for simple math and patterns. She also enjoys coming up with her own structures. The nearly 2-year-old loves to fiddle with the bricks and build her own little structures for the bunnies to sit on. The set is a great balance of building blocks, plus the ""extras"" of a fence piece, carrots, bowl and flowers.

We unfortunately lost the brown bunny a couple weeks ago, and never found it. After looking around on ebay, I finally used the Lego website to ask for a replacement part. Their customer service was excellent--I was on hold less than a minute and they were very proactive in helping me out.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"""Northanger Abbey"" does make a mockery of Gothic Romance.  But Jane Austen shows that you can be passionate towards fiction literature without making fiction reality.  The heroine, Catherine, learns that not everything in reality has a Gothic fiction story.  That fiction is just that.

Catherine Morland (17) goes to Bath with friends.  She then meets Henry Tilney, whom invites her to his family's home -  Northanger Abbey.  Catherine expected a Gothic Abbey to match with the novels she reads (mainly Ann Radcliffe the creator of Gothic Romance).  The comedy is that the Abbey, Henry and the Tilney's are just the opposite.  They are wealthy ""English Christians.""

There are other subtext to parody of social marriages and manners.  Jane Austen's books all have this comedic point if view.

I would recommend this novel."

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight.

The grip is comfortable and the gun is easy to conceal.  I can tell that I am getting a lot of use out of this holster.  I have no complaints about this holster.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"""The Facts of Life"" is one of those great television shows that defined the 80s. It had comedy but easily tackled issues young people were facing such as drugs, sex, and simply morals and things like self-esteem.

This DVD release does what few first season sets don't; it packs in two seasons, includes some actually good extras that includes interviews with some key cast members, and simply gives the fans of the show what they wanted. The transfer to DVD seems okay or decent. The extras, as mentioned, were good ... they included interviews of some of the women who played the girls in the first season (and made a few appearances in season 2).

I didn't remember the show being as funny and engaging as it was from the start into the second season when the cast was downsized and focused on a select few. The writing wasn't too cheesey and the plots were fresh and still are today. This is one of those shows, and DVD releases, that I'd have to say is a ""must own."" This was a piece of television history when T.V. wasn't loaded down with reality shows and poor shows. Get this show on DVD, you won't be disapointed."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Anna Pigeon is a jack of all trades. Not only is she a park ranger with law enforcement training, but she's also an emergency medical technician and a trained firefighter. One wonders a bit how much time it took her to obtain all that training, and whether that's the norm for National Park employees, but quibbles aside, this is a superb book. Barr uses the drama of a fire to isolate her cast of characters in classic locked-room mystery fashion, then cuts them off from the outside world while Anna races against time to figure out who she can trust before she becomes the next victim. If there's a flaw it lies in the fact that a vital clue is a bit too obvious. I can't say more without giving away too much, but people who've read lots of mysteries will probably figure out part of what's going on simply from the way the story is constructed. Firestorm, however, is really a story of fire, firefighters, and the southern Cascades in the vicinity of Mt. Lassen National Park, and minor imperfections in the mystery barely detract from it at all. Highly recommended."

There is carpeting throughout most of the house, and on all 27 (sigh) stairs.  This thing got the stairs cleaner than I thought possible.  We've brought them back to looking brand new - not to mention the work it did on the furniture.  So, when I moved into a house with all hardwood floors but carpeted stairs (wait..what?), and two dogs...I knew what I had to do!  I have a Great Dane, and a Terrier style mutt.  Lots of blonde and white hair is attracted to those stairs.  This thing made them brand spanking new in minutes.  The suction is great - I am continually shocked that it is so powerful.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Review is based on only one use in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, at the Eben Ice Caves.

These cleats work very good on the ice.

Sizing is just right: I purchased a Large, for a size 10.5 men's winter hiking boot. Easy to put on, even outside in the cold. Fit great.

I also purchased a pair of ""Crampon Ice Traction Cleats by Rover Adventure Gear"", in a size Medium. They did NOT fit my boots, but they fit my niece's size 8 woman's winter boot just fine.

The Hillsound cleats are much better quality - the chain is stainless steel instead of basic steel that rusts, and the rubber is thicker and more elastic. But they also cost twice as much.

I did not give these 5 stars because I feel they are a bit over-priced, and they didn't come with a pouch, which the cheaper ones did."

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Described as wittily funny and utterly brilliant I found it neither, though it was intriguing, so I stayed with it. The economy has tanked in the U. S. and anarchy is just beginning to bare its ugly teeth. Stan and Charmaine are without jobs or house (they lost it when they could no longer make the payments), and they're living in their car, moving constantly to avoid roaming gangs and sleeping only in snatches. Charmaine does work a few hours in a dive bar; her best friends now are prostitutes who service their customers in the back room. So when Charmaine sees an ad on TV for the Positron Project in the town of Consilience the couples decides they have nothing to lose. They board a bus for the complimentary trip, they're wined and dined and put up in a nice hotelhot showers! fresh bedsheets! wine with dinner! Not everyone gets in, mind you, and Stan and Charmaine go through a series of workshops meant to weed out the undesirables. If they make it, a house in the cute little 50s-era town of Consilience is theirs. The catch? They spend 30 days in the Positron Prison and 30 days as townspeople for the rest of their lives. Because theres no leaving the Project once you sign on the dotted line. The towns motto? Do time now, buy time for our future. Cons + Resilience = Consilience. Yikes. The rest of the novel is a whirl of selective euthanasia and sex robots and Elvis impersonators and an attempted escape to Las Vegas, of all places! That, and some sort of sex imprinting brain surgery that backfires occasionally, leaving one woman with a fetish for a blue knit teddy bear. The Heart Goes Last is a little bit Truman Show, with a pinch of Stepford Wives and 1984, perhaps. (Heres Atwood talking about the novel on NPR)

Originally written as a serial for the online publisher Byliner, the novel was entertainingbut The Heart Goes Last was no Handmaids Tale. [read more at thisismysymphony."

The knife was a little bit stiff when it arrived and needed some oil to loosen it up.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Sending a shout out to the author-Julie Bailes.  Thank you for the gift of your book.  I told you I'd review and here I am.  Just got done with this book.  What a rollercoaster ride of emotions?!  Ali, the lead female, has endured heartbreaking loss multiple times and yet she endures.  Blake has been her devoted ally for years and is determined to help her heal.  While I enjoyed the book, it seemed a bit hard for me to get into.  I realize all the reasons for how the book is laid out considering the ending... but it seemed to be drawn out and sometimes slow. The ending was a cliff hanger and ended rather unexpectedly.  Still Ms. Bailes is a fine author.  Her story flows, there are no spelling or grammar errors which makes the story easy to follow.  It seemed to take awhile to really get to the heart of the book but once I did, I found myself eagerly following along, cheering for Ali and Blake.  Give Shattered and Shaken a chance.  I'll be looking to add the next parts of this series to my collection."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I have mixed feelings about this book, the things that I liked were also the things that I didn't. Maddie for example, was this sweet girl-woman and throughout the book, it is revealed how much a victim this young girl really was. At the same time, I thought that is exactly what makes her such a complex character to read about. If this was reality, then I would not feel this way, because I think that her overcoming the abuse was so much a part of the story, it would be the furthest thing from entertaining for me to read. For this reason and a few others, one being the connection between Caden and Maddie that was choppy at times, I don't know if I would ever want to read this book again. There is definitely a difference  between the last two books by SM and the earlier ones in this series, one of the problems being that there have been huge breaks between books, and while I want to read a nicely finished book, this just caused me to forget and not care anymore.
I gave the book 4 stars because when Maddie and Caden were at odds with one another, it was written such that I really felt what they were struggling with and for that the author deserves credit. When they were reconciling, Caden showed absolutely the right amount of gentleness I wanted him too. Honestly,  the part where the conflict with his own family was not explained enough, I was  able to take at face value as I would not want to read pages and pages about the extremely violent circumstances of those times, a couple of sentences thrown in here and there were quite enough for me. All in all, a good addition to this series, but not a hot romance as I would like to have read from  SM."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Boy Meets World as a show was great. I enjoyed growing up along with it and I still enjoy watching it now. The first four or five seasons were really wonderful and things went slightly downhill after that. This final season didn't seem to have quite the same magic as the earlier ones but it didn't suck by any means. It was still very enjoyable but you could tell things weren't working as well as before. A lot of the story lines seem awkward or forced and many of the characters acted a little bit out of character in certain situations. In many ways there seemed to be a lot of more serious-toned episodes this season but they always felt very strange and often interweaved with the wackiness and more sit-com style they usually do all in the same episode. This often left you with an awkward feeling while watching. Overall I still recommend it though, especially if you're rounding out your collection. Despite it's pitfalls it's still better than most of the stuff out there. I am glad they ended it after this season though. It would have been a shame to drag it on like so many shows do today."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Cass is a single mother as a result of a one night stand.

Logan was the one night stand.

Now a twist if fate has them meet up again in somewhat secret circumstances.
Cass is Logans boss but she has no clue about his secret that could change everything.

This book started off at a steady pace, then it slowed down in the middle and hit it's stride again in the last 3rd.

Cass and Logan are both head strong and career driven. They have different experiences in life and this shows in each interaction they have. Because of the complexity of their situation there are a lot of undercurrents in their conversations, but only one of them is aware of it.

The author has done a good job showing the different sides to her characters personalities. The chemistry between Logan and Cass never diminishes and the love they have for their daughter despite the intricacies they face shines through and comes above everything else.

I enjoyed this story. The characters and the storyline is consistent and interesting and I liked the dynamics of the other relationships each Cass and Logan have with others such as Logan's grandmother and Cass's friend Patricia. Those relationships added another layer and also a bit of lightness to the storyline.

This is a great holiday read and worth one clicking if you like a good romance!

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I got this in the August Blockhead Box (a dog subscription box).  I have the ""large"" version and, for the record, my dog is an 83-84 pound Rottweiler who is super destructive.

This lasted my dog longer than a lot of cloth-covered toys (I hesitate to call it ""plush"" because it's not particularly soft and doesn't have stuffing).  As in, like five minutes.  Part of the reason was she had a bit of trouble picking it up, but I'm not blaming that on the toy, I'm blaming it on my dog.  She kept trying to pick it up by the middle, while one of her feet was holding the outside part down...anyway, she did eventually get it up.

My dog has the uncanny ability to find the weak point in any toy.  In this case, it is the embroidered KONG logo.  She started gnawing on that after a few minutes and I did eventually have to take it away because she put a few small holes in it near the logo.  For what it's worth, she did LOVE this toy and was sad to have it taken away, and it held up pretty well to tugging.  Also, although there are squeakers, she really didn't squeak this too much (for once, much to my relief...).

In the end, maybe this is not for the heaviest of chewers, but I have no doubt it would work for some dogs (like my last Rottie, who was very gentle with toys).  The large is appropriate for large breed dogs.  Although my dog is on the small side for a Rottie, I would feel comfortable giving this to a dog 20 or 30 pounds heavier, as well.  I would definitely supervise at first, especially if you know your dog is destructive."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"I bought this to mount Board Buddies on my Dewalt-744 table saw.  The saw has a 19.5"" fence, so I had to cut the aluminum slide on both ends with a hack saw so that the wood screw holes would be centered over an auxiliary wooden fence a.k.a feather board that I made.  The saw's aluminum fence is 1"" wide with screws on its back side away from the blade.  I had to replace the Dewalt screws with equivalent 2"" sheet metal screws to attach the featherboards.  I made the wooden fence out of two pieces of 3/4"" hickory so that it would be hammer-handle tough.  I needed two pieces to make the fence wide enough to take wood screws from the slider as it is 2 1/4"" wide.  The holes for the wood screws in the slider are set 1 3/4"" from the edge.  Ideally, one would make the featherboard out of one piece that is 1 1/4"" thick, but good luck trying to find some.

All went well until I had to screw the aliminum slide onto the auxilary wooden fence.  I drilled deep pilot holes.  But, two of the brass-colored wood screws provided with the slide snapped off when the screws got deep into the wood.  The first time it happened, I was able to recover by separating the two hickory boards and unscrew the stub because the screws fell exactly between the featherboards.  Then I decided to glue the boards together so that the screws would be more secure.  On my second attempt to mount the slider, a second wood screw snapped.  This one was much more difficult to extract.  I had to use a hand grinder to dig a pit around the stub so that I could get a lock wrench on it.

MY ADVICE:  use the stainless steel wood screws that are supplied with the Board Buddies instead of the cheap brass-colored screws that come with the slider."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"You can make plans and decide what your path in life will be.  That is all well and good, but... sometimes life has other plans for you and no matter how stubborn you are about staying in the path you have chosen, you will need to adapt and accept that nothing in life is perfect.  It is out of those imperfections, or deviations if you will, that life presents us with challenges and triumphs we may have otherwise missed.

Our story follows Sophie as she is about to achieve her life-long desire to become a teacher. She has done everything in her power to put herself through college while supporting her brother and her wheelchair-bound father.  It has taken incredible determination and self-control to achieve this.

When William comes into her life, she recognizes there is something special between them.  Letting this unique attraction grow is both scary and invigorating.  How they recognize this feeling is mutual and growing is the constant undercurrent to our story.

In the end, we walk away knowing life is full of challenges.  A well-planned future has to be adjustable.  We must bend to the unexpected trials we find along our way to our future.  Love is the constant and family sustains us."

DEFINITELY will not hold the weight of an adult though, which was a little disappointing... we had our sons birthday party and he wanted me to sit with him and it about broke before I even put all my weight on it and I'm only 130. I don't think it would honestly hold more than 4 kids unless some sat on the joints. It held fine when my son (40lbs) sat on one bench but when his friend sat next to him (30 lbs) it began to creak and bend. The table top itself is a lot more sturdy. Our dog (60lbs) likes to lay on the table with our puppy (50lbs) and no bending or anything. Overall good buy, a little bit of a pain to put together but worth it for the safety factor."

This was a super quick, sweet little read that follows a jaded journalist and a male romance novelist. I was a bit shocked at the length of this book -- I wanted more and wasn't expecting it to be novella length! Sara Hantz writes extremely well -- the dialogue was easy to follow and it was easy to get lost in the feelings of Sheridan and Mac. The reader goes through the entire emotional wheel with Sheridan as she's told she's not getting the assignment she wants, and then through her falling process.

Like I said, I wish it had been longer, but this is a good taste at the writing of Sara Hantz"

I sympathize with fellow reviewers who have been disappointed to see a Sherlock that is less than heroic; less ""in control.""  However, his behavior in Season 3 just goes to show how important John Watson is to the stability and grounding of an almost out of control force that is Sherlock Holmes.  There are moments in ""His Last Vow"" that are simply heartbreaking to watch. The plot is completely unpredictable and left me on the edge of my seat.  Despite many harrowing moments, what carries the day is that these two friends clearly understand and trust each other despite their suffering.  This goes beyond a simple ""bromance.""  This relationship is epic and makes this version of Sherlock Holmes the most compelling I've seen.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I believe there are more than enough reviews here to decifer whether or not you plan to read this  charming, witty and candid book. However, as an Australian raised in both Europe and America, I must heed a warning to those of you who read the negative reviews by Europeans and Asians. DO NOT LISTEN TO THEM!! They obviously lack a sense of humour and the ability to laugh at themselves (unlike Bryson).  Bryson can be provincial at times, but he is so charming indeed! One who has traveled for days in a foreign land can understand his exhaustion and frustration and will howl with laughter.
Yes, Bryson at times can be brutally honest with his opinion of foreign countries and their inhabitants and culture, but they are HIS OPINIONS and they are frankly FUNNY and quite observant. I suppose those who take offense to his opinions neglected to understand that Bryson is a brazen self critic  and will unabashedly admit to his lack of sophistication due to his stereotypical midwestern American upbringing.

The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put the collar on.  The front part is very loose, and the back is very loose.  The only way to get it on is to bend it around and put it back on.  That's a pretty tough job, and it's been a lot of trouble since I got it.  I'm not sure I"

There's nothing outstanding about it; it's not a unique plot, the acting is so-so - but for some reason none of that hurts it's watchability. It's just a good movie."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"From the female of the family: This beautiful top is a lot more than a ""T-shirt."" It is simple, yet elegant. It's reversible -- no, you don't wear it inside out -- but can wear front or back as the front! This means, the neck is either ""boat"" or a shallow V.

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

I've only come across the Royal Robbins brand recently and I think the quality and style of their lines are excellent.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A SANDY'S SEASHELL SHOP CHRISTMAS is a novella about a young widow named Tiff Riley and her three and a half year old son, Micah, who spend Christmas on the Outer Banks. Tiff had lost her husband, Aaron, to the war in Afghanistan. She hadn't even had much of a chance to be with him for very long before he was taken away from her. The tragedy of losing her husband and Micah's father at Christmas during the war in Afghanistan was heart-wrenching. She was struggling so badly trying to get through each day. Tiff's grief and disinclination to the prior three Christmases left her feeling empty. Just to be able to make it she ran to the one place she knew her husband loved the best, the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Sandy's sensitivity and perseverance as she drew Tiff and Micah into her Seashell Shop's Christmas party and the impact of the festivities on this family was inspiring.

If you love Lisa Wingate's books you don't want to miss this little gem. Especially if you have fallen in love with her Carolina series as much as I have. Deserving of 5 stars."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,This tv mini series is a real shame because it is a real shame that the entire series has been closed down.

I have watched it
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This book is basically a continuous of book one. It pretty much picks up where book one ended. The only difference is there is more of Bran And Tyrone's point of view through out this book along with Lance and Tide.

In this book I was able to see that Lance and Tide where able to feel more comfortable in their relationship. I feel that theirs is more of a relationship and less based around the BDSM lifestyle. I feel like they practice parts of the BDSM lifestyle but they r definitely not 24/7. I feel like each day that passes Lance was more comfortable in his own skin and that Tide is really good for Lance because Lance feels like he has the freedom to be himself and enjoy his desires because Tide supports him in his choices. They really are a great couple in my opinion.

Tyrone and Bran have been together for a long time in what I would definitely say is a 24/7 Dom/Sub lifestyle. They know each other's wants and needs but I feel like they have gotten complacent in their relationship and do not realize they are not meeting each other's emotional needs any longer but instead only the physical needs. Don't get me wrong they are still a very much strong couple in my opinion but I feel like maybe they are too comfortable with each other and I believe that Brans tumor scare is exactly what they needed even though I wish I could have happened in a better way.

Bran and Tyrone have to reevaluate their relationship and make changes and I believe this is a very good thing we're their relationship is concerned and I have no doubt that hey will continue to be a very strong, loving couple in future books in this series.

I cannot wait till the next one comes out if their is a next one that is. I enjoyed getting to know these two couples and hope to read more about them in the future."

Pros:
-Good sound quality

Cons:

My only complaint is that the battery life is pretty short.  I used this for about a week and I am very happy with the results.

They rivalry and fighting to get the other gets to a one point that one of them is ready to drop off all pass feuds,cause she's having guilty thoughts for what had done to the other one. The story is funny ,humorous and make you think that sometimes that no everything you see or hear about it is true.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I decided to jump on the chromebook bandwagon since so many people were raving about it. I will say that if you're used to having a Windows laptop and expect this to feel the same, you will be very disappointed. Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader. None work with chromebook, and extentions that might have were a hassle to figure out. I didn't have a fresh goat or virgin to sacrifice on hand to make this task seamless. Not being able to download popular apps for all of my favorite things was the ultimate deal breaker for me. Some people will say you can do anything on a chromebook you can do on a windows or Mac laptop, but who wants to spend their day finding loop holes in a new system. I want simple with an easy user interface.

The good side; if you don't want all the fancy bells and whistles and just feel like browsing the web and checking your email, this will be perfect for you. If you have a Gmail account, you'll love it even more with the way it integrates your account with everything made by Google. Just don't try to watch a dvd or listen to a CD since thus has no disk drive. But hey, the battery does last an awful long time."

He plays with it for at least 20 minutes at a time, dumping all of the pieces together and then putting each puzzle together separately.  He rarely even needs to ask for help.  As a parent I LOVE the different shapes printed on the back of the pieces to differentiate the separate puzzles when putting them away in their own compartments.  I highly recommend it as a great toy for any child 3 and up."
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This is a mediocre yet tolerable romantic comedy. It tries to be like Romancing the Stone but it falls short. The acting isn't too great, the characters cheesy and the plot silly but it's watchable.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!

I wasn't too impressed by how the film looked. It hasn't held up well at all in 20 years. This was made in 1992 but the quality of the movie makes it seem like it was made in '72."

I've washed it with soap and water and it's still soapy.  I just put it in the dishwasher and it still looks great.  I would recommend this product for anyone"
Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"but, then, I realized that it has no memory expandability, a small screen, and a non-replaceable battery. I wondered why. Then, I happened upon the Aiptek A-HD+ 1080P which had all those features and more. It weighs a tiny bit more, but gives much more bang for the buck. A little bit cheaper too. Not as sexy though. Anyway, I bought the Aiptek and that's that. It's well worth considering. Just a tip, IMHO.

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture. I continue to recommend looking at it as you shop. Variety is the spice of life you know."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Low-end, Shimano/SRAM hub compatible 9-speed cassette.  It's heavy, and designed for steel hubs.  Works like a champ.  Holds up to high wattage, and standing on a climb in the large gear.

If you have aluminum or titanium hubs, or are concerned about a couple of ounces of weight, then you want a higher-numbered cassette with a large-gear spider.

This is very wide range, pretty evenly stepped from 11T to 34T.  This is great for a compact double crankset (34/50), giving a 1:1 (WHEELIES!) for monster climbs, and a 4.5:1 for powering downhill at 35mph.

Since it's 9-speed, and such a wide range, you may find some of the mid spacing a little too much if you are mostly on even, flat pavement.

If you do only hard, off-road climbs, you may find this is not enough (vs some of the new 42T pizza plates lately).
END 2014 review

EDIT 2017 - Subtracting a star because the description now says it has a spider, but it does not.  A spider is a solid block of aluminum serving as the core for the biggest cogwheels.  It reduces weight, and distributes the load so high-wattage does not dig into the freehub splines.  THIS CASSETTE DOES NOT HAVE THAT.  The description should not say it does."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"A great recipe book for anyone who wants to impress their family, friends, co-workers  (or themselves!) with delicious desserts. There's a lot to like about it. Here are my five reasons for giving it five stars:

1) An excellent introduction to the whole process of cooking caramel for those who are new to this delicious endeavor. Dennis Waller describes all the necessary equipment and provides helpful tips in his easy-to-read and easy-to-follow introduction.

2) All recipes follow the same format - and that's excellent because it helps those of us who have not done much with caramel before figure out what the main steps are in ALL caramel recipes. The same format makes these recipes easy to follow, thus, there's less likelihood of messing up.

3) I love the idea of adding some variety to the recipes, and Dennis Waller provides suggestions and options of what to change and how to change it. Love the idea of using spiced rum and Kahlua instead of vanilla! I'll just have to make sure I don't test-taste too much of either while cooking.

4) An excellent variety of recipes for different occasions, from more traditional to experimental.  Pumpkin Spice Caramel (and its Apple Spice version) and Spiced Pumpkin Fudge sound perfect for fall celebrations. Pecan Praline Caramel and Grandma Stella's Caramel would be great for the holiday season. The ones I'd like to try first are Spicy Chocolate Caramel made with Cayenne and Paprika peppers, Amaretto Almond Caramel, Bourbon Chocolate Pecan Caramel, and Chocolate Mint Fudge.

5) Pecan Pralines made with dried fruit deserve their own star!  Who wouldn't want to have dried mango, papaya, dates,  shredded coconut, or pineapple in their dessert. That will make it healthy, too. The five food groups, lots of fruit, and all that, right?"

He is very happy with the item and it is a great gift. We love this hammock! It's a great camping hammock. It has a very comfortable feel to it. It is very easy to install. You can easily move it around, put it in a bag or box and put it in a closet or a car. You can also put it on a trailer and it will take a while to get it into the car.

The blade is a bit of a pain to operate, but it's not a problem.  The construction is very solid and the blade does not slip.  I have a few small holes in the plastic housing on the blade so I don't have to worry about it falling off.  The blade is smooth and a good value for the price.  I would recommend this saw to anyone.I love these lamps.  They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great.  I love the way they dim to a bright white.

Disappointed to find out that it isn't a stand alone tent.  Not Amazons fault, it clearly states one pole, I just didn't think about it meaning that it wouldnt stand alone. Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground. Also it is a big large for a two man tent. Hopefully he will be able to use it eventually."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the absolute best party games ever.  I bought A2A at a local game shop on a whim years ago.  My Amazon purchase was the big set for a friend and his family.  Be prepared for hours of fun.

Here is the general idea:

First, get a group of people wanting some social fun
Second, pass our the Noun cards (they aren't called that, but that's what they are)
Third, start with someone called the ""jusdge"" who picks up an adjective card (again, not what they are called, but it's what they are)
Fourth, the judge tosses the card into the center and other players pick a noun that embodies the card the judge tossed out.

The person who is the round's ""judge"" tosses out a card that is a descriptor.  Let's say that the word is ""Hot.""  Other players look through their collection of cards to find a word that embodies ""hot.""  One player might toss in ""Marylin Monrow"" and another might toss in ""The Sun.""  Which will the judge choose?  Maybe your comments might influece the outcome.  Go wild!

This is a game learned by new players in less than a minute.  If it's not on your game shelf, it should be.

Note: we play with a local rule that's similar to musical chairs: The judge rejects the last entry on the table.  This encourages fast play.  If all players play a card quickly, the judge has the option to accept all entries."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"For those like myself who wondered how a bunch of English kids had such a huge impact on pop music in the 60s and beyond, this book explains a lot - a first hand account from one of the most important figures of the British Invasion.  Keith talks about the Stones early influences and how they progressed from covering American Rhythm and Blues to writing their own material and becoming what many considered the greatest Rock and Roll band of their time.

Its a wild ride, full of sex  (Ronnie Spector, Anita Pallenberg, Marianne Faithful, etc.),  drugs (pot, speed, freebase cocaine, heroin, etc.), and Rock and Roll.

Only disappointment was that even though he talked about a lot of their biggest hits - Satisfaction, Start Me Up, Miss You, Jumpin' Jack Flash, and so on - he didn't say a word about Shes So Cold, which I always thought was a great song, and an important one because it made a statement - that after Disco and Punk Rock had pretty much come and gone, the Stones were still around, and they could still come up with a tune that was better than anything anyone else had out there."

The jacket comes very stiff, but softened up after washing once. After a few more washed I feel that it will mold even better. It is insulated and fairly thick. It is perfect for low temperatures with layers underneath. The zipper works great and we haven't experienced any issues with this jacket. It looks just like the picture!

My son picked this jacket out himself (he is 12) and I am very pleased with his selection."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"There is really only one reason to watch an Andy Warhol production of a Paul Morrissey film starring Joe Dallesandro--and that is the hope that, somewhere along the way, you are going to see Dallesandro naked. A military brat who ran wild, Dallesandro did a number of nude modeling jobs for ""physique"" magazines before he stumbled into Warhol in 1967. Warhol knew a good thing when he saw it, and for the next several years Dallesandro would appear in one Warhol produced film after another, most of them directed by Paul Morrissey. The trouble is that Warhol was a bad producer, Morrissey was a ho-hum director, and Dallesandro is one of the most wooden actors to grace the screen. But whether he's naked, in a three piece suit, or stomping around in a swim suit--well, he just looks so damn good you can't help but watch his every move. Released in 1972, HEAT has the barest plot imagineable. Dallesandro is a former child television star who wanders into a cheap motel that includes a swimming pool, a grotesque landlady, a couple of brothers who do a nightclub act in which they have sex, and a nitwit woman who claims to be a lesbian and whose mother (Sylvia Miles) is a fading star. Pretty soon Dallesandro is getting naked with the landlady and ultimately he gets naked with the fading star--but when she becomes too possessive he walks out. Throw in the occasional reference to SUNSET BLVD and that's pretty much it. The cinematography is dull and so is most of the cast. Miles is loud and shrewish, but she gives the film what little energy it has. Dallesandro, of course, adds his part to the film by looking drop-dead, rough-trade gorgeous. But unless you're hot to see Miles' sagging breasts or Dallesandro's butt and a quick crotch flash, you might want to give HEAT a miss."

I loved this book! It was a great read.  I had a lot of fun with the characters and the storyline.  This book had a lot of fun in it's own way.  This book is a great series for adults and teens.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.

I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.I enjoyed this book. I love how the heroine is a strong heroine. The story is very well written and I liked how she is in a relationship with her man. I like that the story is not over. I love how the heroine is able to overcome her fears to make her relationship work. This is a fun story and I recommend it.I loved this book. It was very good and I'm happy to see that it's ending. I'm not a big fan of endings in books. I like the hero and heroine but not the heroine. I just liked the way the story was written. I'll be reading the next one in the series.Great book.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I really want to give this watch 5 stars, this watch is excellent, high quality, accurate, and great looking, but it loses a star for the weight. Don't get me wrong though i understand all types of these watches are going to be heavy when compared to my g shocks. Wearing the watch daily is not very comfortable, it is a bit heavy and can get sweaty during the summer which is normal, but after weaing my casio g shock which cost $150. I really appreciated the lightweight and comfort of the affordable g shock watch. The seiko is indeed a classy watch but the downside is that is it heavier than my g shock which i end up choosing to wear daily.

This is a great watch for going out and relaxing, but for sports, work, daily tasks, the g shock is my goto watch since its lighter weight and more comfortable with its resin band.

It is hard to make a steel watch very comfortable compared to a resin watch. Otherwise everything else is perfection..Seiko is one of my favorite brand of watches, I would say my top favorite, then Casio, but realistically my daily wear is a casio g shock. If you type of watch is the classy look, then seiko is the best. It's kinetic technology is my favorite, i love how it adjust back to the correct time after i wake it up by a few shakes. It is amazing how accurate this watch is, I set the time and date once, and have had this watch for 4 years and not once did i ever need to readjust the time or date, it has been accurate this whole time.  this watch is excellence, but i deduct one star because I feel its a bit heavy as it should be but just not my cup of tea for a daily wear since I have a lightweight casio g shock as my option."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Spider-Man 2 is better than the original Spider-Man. I feel I should get that out of the way first, since most sequels have a tough time topping the first one. However, I feel Spider-Man 2 is only better in the sense that if the same production staff remade Spider-Man, it should naturally be better. That's what this sequel feels like, a literal remake with some spiced up elements here and there. It's a good film, but it's not really the way I thought a sequel should be.

Effects are even better than the first, and the tentacles of Doc Ock make for some truly spectacular battles, including a centerpiece on a runaway train. Tobey Maguire continues to give an excellent portrayal of Peter Parker, and has good chemistry with Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. Alfred Molina has more to work with as Doc Ock than Dafoe did as the Goblin, and humanizes what was once a wacky villain. James Franco continues to develop Harry Osborn well, and the supporting cast like JK Simmons and Rosemary Harris fill out the high-caliber acting.

But the script needs work. It uses one of the worst superhero cliches as the main plot, that of the hero calling it quits. It's never convincing, and the film drags as we wait for Peter to realize things we've known all along. Character relationships, though well-acted, don't seem to have progressed since the first movie. We're still treading the Peter/Mary Jane love triangle, just with a different third wheel. Harry still has his on/off friendship with Peter. There are nice plot twists that shake things up towards the end, but most of the film is wasted on the exact same angst from the first one. For a story supposedly set 3 years later, it might as well have been 3 days.

We get a dvd with good extras and audio/video presentation. I enjoy Spider-Man 2 on its own, and it's nice to have it in my dvd library, but as a sequel it's not fresh enough for me. Hopefully next year's Spider-Man 3 will fix that."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this because my son was given a similar track system made by a competitor and loved it for the short time it functioned (hand-me-down gift).  However, all the vehicles were broken or lost besides the one I managed to rig up for a while.  I set out to find replacement cars and could not.  So buying this was the next best thing.

Let me tell you...my son absolutely loves this set.  In fact, he didn't stop playing with it for the entire first day he had it.  It seems well-made taking the price into account.  The track length is actually perfect considering I use the other one simultaneously. The cars have a lot of ""get up and go"", as well.

I am most impressed with the inclusion of extra parts.  I'd read reviews on Amazon before purchasing this set that complained about issues with the tire treads...When I opened the box, I found several replacement treads among other extras.  The track is easy for me to assemble and dis-assemble, but not for my two year old.

The set I received actually had a few additional parts to the track not shown in the picture, which adds to the fun!

I'm worried about the cars being damaged because my son is a bit rough with them and there seems to be no way to replace just the vehicles if this does happen. So that annoys me, but overall I'm very pleased with this purchase and my son didn't stop smiling...My 9-year-old god son likes it, as well!!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Romantic suspense is at its very best with this latest read from Ms. Wainscott. Wrapped up in one terrific package is a rampant serial killer, a controlling husband, a beaten-down wife, and a handsome mysterious loner all connected in this intricate and suspenseful plot.
With the reappearance of ""Spooky Silas"" Koole, Katie is reminded of the girl she used to be before she married local vet and her savior, Ben Ferguson. After her mother died, Katie lived with another family and was befriended by Ben who had aided her when Gary, the bully, injured her kitten. Now, after nine years of marriage, Katie is but a shell of her former self, complacent and pleasing, no longer the spirited girl Silas remembered.
Even as Silas warns Katie to trust no one, the serial killer strikes again, leaving no body, and Silas is the main suspect. And fear strikes Katie, as the list of possible suspects cleverly emerges: Is it Gary, the kitten abuser and gruff cop, Harold, the creepy ""art"" dealer, Silas, who empathetically feels the killer, or Ben, the town hero and control freak husband?
As love emerges between loner Silas and a damaged Katie, it becomes so much more than just romance, mainly a culmination of life-long love deepening into mature adult love. As they begin to trust one another, Katie is forced to question her marriage, her mother's death years before, and her life, as she has known it for the last nine years.
Ms. Wainscott's latest is a masterpiece of mystery, chock full of suspense, and brimming with romantic attraction. Readers unfamiliar with this rising star's work will definitely want to check out this latest suspenseful novel."

The only change I would make if I could, would be to have it 2 or 3 inches shorter.  It was designed for people walking and picking up trash so when I am sitting down, it is just a bit to long."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"As a reader who is not an aficionado of speculative fiction or alternative historical fiction, this novel left me rather perplexed. Having read Robert Harris Fatherland a number of years ago (and having enjoyed it) and spurred by the popularity of the Amazon TV series inspired by Dicks novel, I dove in.

Set in an alternate post-WWII America that has been divided by the victorious Japanese and Nazis, the narrative focuses on five or six characters whose stories never quite coalesce; the fragmented narrative structure in itself is not necessarily a flaw (plenty of good novels feature fragmented narratives), but in Dicks novel, it definitely creates a lack of coherence that ultimately enervates the novel. More than half the book is devoted to exposition, but the payoffwhich doesnt really emerge until the final three chapters or so, once again in very fragmented fashionfeels uncertain and anticlimactic. Complicating matters is a novel within the novel, an alternate history that presumes the Allies had won the war but is itself different from the actual historical record (e.g., FDR did not serve four terms as President). Excerpts from this novel, called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, along with the I Ching, which every character seems to consult for guidance, appear throughout the story, yet again these elements fail to add any sort of coherence to the narrative.

Perhaps my lack of expertise in this genre handicaps my appreciation of this novel (which did, after all, win the Hugo Award), but I was, in the end, disappointed."

Note 1: Apple products use their own rules to decide charging speed. A designed-for-Apple charger may be slow to charge non-Apple devices, and vice versa.

Note 2: Blocking other outlets. Seems like small thing, but it can be a hassle. Unplugging hotel room lamps, alarm clocks, etc. to charge your phone? Just say no (or carry an extension cord).

Silas is a package and a half. He keeps Molly (and us) on edge with his dirty talk and his tenderness. It's an enigma and I love hearing all the sexy details coming out of his mouth.
This conclusion provides resolution for Molly. Her character was so very strong and determined and justice was served through the help of her devoted friends and Silas. She is a champion and you can't help but wonder how many ""Mollys"" were broken because of the situation they were born into.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,"There are many believability hoops that need to be jumped through before the book is truly a success. The story is told from the point of view of the heroine and the hero, and it's a bit confusing at times.

I was also frustrated by the use of the word ""love"" in the title of the book. I'm not sure if it was a typo or something. I just didn't feel it was used right. The heroine was an interesting character, and I liked her.

The ending was a bit too abrupt, which I liked"

Xander is in a hospital recovering from an injury. He is on his way to a one night stand and his body is badly hurt. He is running out of money and is going to go to a doctor. He meets a woman who is very sweet and is very supportive. He also gets a woman who is also very supportive. When he meets the woman who is so sweet and loving he just can't put it down. He is on his way to a doctor and she is very excited to see him. I loved this book. It was so well written and the characters were so well developed. I loved that the story flowed so well.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"So how have I made it this far in life without reading this book?  After finally taking the opportunity to finish it, I wonder how I made it through high school and through a Political Science degree without having read Nineteen Eighty-Four.

I chose to purchase this book on audio and loved the narration.  I felt as if I could feel Winston's thoughts as he made a journey to question the life that he was living and question ""the party.""  This book reaffirmed my love for the freedoms that I enjoy in so many different ways - the freedom to love, to travel, to have a family and friends, to ask questions, to write and acknowledge my feelings, to READ!  This world that Orwell created, and described in such realistic detail, was a nightmare and was in such contradiction to the democratic freedoms that I know.

I think that what struck me the most was the love affair that Winston shared with Julia.  That it was forbidden was horrible, but the lengths that they had to go to be together and to hide their relationship was astounding. Winston risked everything to trust Julia, and he did so with full force, with everything that he had.

The optimist in me hoped for an overthrow of this world that was described in Nineteen Eighty-Four.  I wanted the characters to experience the world  that I live in, because the alternative that was presented was so unspeakable.  This novel was amazing for its ability to make me appreciate what I have, to describe something so very opposite to what I know.

I hope that everyone has an opportunity to read it and is able to appreciate their reality just a little more, because they have received a little glimpse of Orwell's alternative."

I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the cats love it.  They are able to go outside on it and it is well made and does not leak.

They play with it until they are bored, then they chase it and play with it for hours!  It's a great toy!  It's very sturdy and sturdy for our dogs.

The title is difficult to understand, as it contains so much information.  Titles and information needs to be clear and not ambiguous and this item title could be much clearer.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?"

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased this for around $130 as a back up. I figure, I am spending this much money, it oughtta be a pretty decent unit. Well, while it stores information, the transfer rate is HORRIBLE, even when plugged into a USB 2.0 certified port. While trying to access this HDD through my computer, it takes anywhere from 5-15 seconds for all the information to register on the HDD. In other words, when you click to access the HDD, none or only part of what is stored on the HDD is available until it loads fully, which can take as much as 15 seconds. The thing is, is that there is still about 1.25TB left, so transfer rates should NOT be this slow. I expected this to respond much faster. I would say that to transfer 60GB it takes about an hour. I can transfer files between my 700GB Caviar Black and 640GB Caviar Blue WAAAAAAY faster than from my Black to this. And the Caviar Black is a pretty speedy little HDD. Is this something that should be expected from large storage units?

Bottom line, if you have the ability to spend a little more for a better unit, I suggest doing so. Perhaps I got one that isn't functioning to its full potential. Perhaps I don't know how to use a PnP device... Hahaha. Right. At least it stores the information.

3.29.2012 Update

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

All that said, it's a great addition.  If you can afford the cost-of-entry, you'll be amazed how shallow the system feels with it off."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.
My wife loves this unit... I have heard her use it several times late at night. Now her running friends 'join' in on the boxing fun."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"It was a case of All or Nothing for me. The crux of story sold me even though there were parts I did not like. An aptly named series, Wicked Games play out in this book for Jena. Unwittingly playing a game she has no idea she is a participant in, it appears that by the end of the game she could lose everything. Character and story issues left me with mixed emotions. I liked King, but I did not like his original game plan and I had a hard time reconciling the man who went into the game with eyes wide open to the probable repercussions of what he put in play with the man who fought for his woman at the end. We also got just enough info on King and Wick to know they are not good guys, but not enough to know what exactly it is they do. At times, their actions did not match their words and this disturbed me greatly. Jena came across as dumb as a box of rocks, dismissing what was happening around her by resorting to excuses and sticking her head in the sand. She evoked frustration and sympathy simultaneously, but it was her weakness that lost me in the end. Timeline issues unsettled me as well, as in when did King and Wick meet? Was it in when they were kids or in the military? It cant be both in my head, yet both were stated as facts. A proper back story on those two would have improved this book immensely, probably cleared that issue up and added some character depth that was missing. A little more about Jenas old job would have been nice too. And after all that you're wondering why I said I liked it? It was all about the game for me and on that level it delivered to the point of me wanting Wicks story next. Spices Rating: 3."

If you know how to pair a Bluetooth device, you know how to use this. It's that simple. It's also small and light, so no hassle there.

I paired it with my Galaxy S7. It took less than 30 seconds start to finish. Per the instructions, open your camera app and push the appropriate shutter button (there's one for iDevices and one for Android). In my case, either button worked just fine. YMMV. Much better than using the hand gestures that are baked in to the S7, in my opinion.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Issues and/or things to note:
1. Body proportions are all on point except for his head which is kinda small especially in comparison to Cap unless his helmet is supposed to be skin tight LOL
2. Diaphragm/ab and waist points of articulation are pretty loose.
3. More gaps than usual/before in the sculpt to where you can see through a lot of the figure at the points of articulation. (ex: upper and lower neck gaps, tailbone(?) area, and etc.)
4. Weird sculpt/design in some places. Giant, flat knee joints again and quite a few pieces that are sculpted outward on the figure that you should be wary of in case of breaking off like 2 little tabs on the back and the elbows which stick out a lot this time in a pretty ugly way.

Improvements from older Iron Man figures:
1. Body proportions are way better; bulkier as it should be to represent an actual man in a suit.
2. Repulsors on palms are painted this time unlike on the Mark 45.
3. I appreciate the little blue paint lines in each of the mini arc reactors all around the suit because I expected them to all just be plain silver.

Other than those, it's still an overall awesome figure. I suggest you watch AnthonysCustoms review of it on youtube if you want more details.
This Mark 46 is to the Mark 45 as the AOU Cap is to the CW Cap; Lots of similarities in pros And cons. But in the end, this is indeed my favorite Iron Man figure to date and in my opinion I think it's the best one that's been released so far."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"After the solid third season, Frasier came back with what could arguably be its best season. There were new storylines: Martin meeting a new lady, Sherry (played by Marsha Mason), who doesn't exactly hit it off with the rest of the gang--as well as continuations of old ones: Niles trying to reconcile with Maris. The biggest story of this season, though, was off-camera: star Kelsey Grammer went into rehab, which necessitated that the others in the cast pick up the slack. They proved up to the task, of course, and upon Grammer's return the show became better than ever. In this season, we were visited by familiar faces like Lilith and Frederick for a memorable Thanksgiving episode, as well as Agent Bebe, as well as surprise appearances (James Earl Jones). In addition, this season contained some of the truly greatest episodes of this show: the opener, The Two Mrs. Cranes, had the show's farcical sense of its humor at its most potent, Ham Radio featured delightfully unhinged performances by the supporting cast, and Are You Being Served? features one of the show's funniest moments. This is where the show hit its peak: the synthesis of great acting, writing, and ensemble acting that made this show memorable. If you love Frasier, these episodes are probably many of the reasons why. If you only buy one set of Frasier DVDs, this should probably be it."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake."

OK only IMO. Sound quality unimpressive, buttons are right where you would touch them if you are pushing these buds back in your ears, so I was continually turning them off by accident.

But these white ones are much shorter probably 1/4 - 1/2"" shorter in the toes. So my toes are a little cramped. The bad thing about it was that I had already worn them out and about in town before I realized that they were so much smaller so I didn't really feel comfortable sending them back after wearing them for 4 or 5 hours. I  sure wish that I could have swapped them for a 9 wide but it is too late now because I have tried to tough it out and wear them anyway this week. But I will know next time to make sure that the shoe fits very well when I first put them on. I had a stroke 13 years ago and these are the only style shoe that I can wear now.

What a great surprise for him to confront her about it. Too funny! I definitely want MORE, MORE, and MORE! I love the authors ability to keep you completely entertained, surprised by the characters' actions, and not ruining the book by repetitive previous statements trying to keep you in the loop! I very much dislike when authors keep referring to past events like you haven't been reading the book for months and suddenly pick it back up to read. None of that here! Get the book.

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

I've attached a video of my son using the net. My other son is the cheerleading voice you hear rooting for him."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first Nicholas Spark novel I have read.  I've seen the movie version of ""The Notebook"" (one of my favorite movies) and ""Nights in Rodanthe"", which I enjoyed.  I saw this book selling for fifty cents at a used book store and figured I'd give it a try, as usually the book is better than the movie.

I was surprised at how quickly I read through this book. I haven't read a fiction book in a long time and found myself inspired to pick it up two nights in a row.  I probably finished it in about 4 or 5 hours.

Even though it wasn't all that deep, I really enjoyed it. And though I knew the ending before I even picked up the book, tears flowed freely at the end (I did however, like the ending of the movie better.  The scene where she sits waiting for him after cooking an amazing meal was so sad and I was really surprised at the ending.)

I liked it enough that I want to read more of Spark's novels.  I am definitely going to read another one very soon."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"From the very beginning of this series, I knew that Gretchen de la O had given us a gem. What I hadn't expected was the respectful, slow and magical transition from YA to more Adult. You literally feel like you are growing up with Wilson Mooney, our heroine of the series.

In the final installment to the Wilson Mooney Series, we finally get to know what happened in the epic cliffhanger of ""Eighteen At Last."" Wilson and Max are reeling from the last few days. Max, dealing with the death of his father and Wilson with the decisions she has made as a result of hurt feelings and misunderstandings.

The one thing that is hard for me to remember, even though Max is Wilson's teacher, he is still relatively young himself. Two young people dealing with a love so epic, there are bound to be major bumps in the road.

However, the one constant is their unquestionable love for one another. ""Beyond Eighteen"" delivers us the stunning conclusion while adding its own bit of drama for Max and Wilson. Before they an truly move on with their rest of their lives, Max must face what the death of his father means for his future when the conditions of the will come to light. Wilson must likewise finalize things with the death of her grandfather and figure out what the next steps will be with her mother.

A beautiful series written for the hopeless romantic in all of us, Gretchen does not disappoint with the HEA and delivers a book boyfriend the teenage girl and young lady in all of us dreamed existed."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Books about successful technology companies are usually written by the entrepreneurs who founded the companies. It is truly remarkable for a book about a company which has grown from nothing to one of the largest computer companies in the world, written by an employee with a HR background and another employee with a diversity background. However, that is what we find with this book by Gina Qiao and Yolanda Conyers, suggesting that the key features of the company are at least as much tied up in its attitude towards employees and diversity as they are in the actual products the company sells.

The book describes a company which began with a group of Chinese scientists who had no commercial experience. Starting by renting out their expertise, then becoming distributors for international computer brands, then creating a Chinese-language motherboard, Legend Computers gradually grew to a position of dominance in the Chinese market before changing its English name to Lenovo and turning its ambitions towards a global market.

Many international companies have suffered culture shocks trying to take over Chinese companies; this book described the culture shocks Lenovo faced digesting the acquisition of the IBM personal computers business. A typical multinational company has a headquarters and dominant culture in one country; Lenovo has chosen not to pursue that route. It has adopted English as its language of businesses, requiring a significant sacrifice on the part of its founders and original staff. In different parts of the world, local culture prevails, rather than a monolithic head-office-imposed culture.

This book describes one way in which a truly international company can succeed, but it requires a lot of trust-building and willingness to sacrifice ones own interests. According to the authors:

We don't just say nice words about cultural diversity; we live it. That is the Lenovo Way."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"We got this at a garage sale a year and a half ago for my two boys(now almost 2 and almost 4 & yep it's pink, but they don't care at all). They have LOVED playing with this kitchen. The woman we bought it from had three kids and my kids have used it for a year and a half and you can hardly tell because the kitchen looks as good as new.

I said that the company was great because when I bought the kitchen it was missing the sink. I went to the website to see about ordering a replacement sink. I was afraid that the sink would cost me as much as the entire kitchen cost, but they sent the replacement sink to me for free. I filled out a form and said that the sink had been lost and within a few days a brand new sink was sitting on my front porch. This tells me that the company stands behind their product. I would definitely buy KidKraft products again."

The scenery is beautiful and the story is very well told.  I highly recommend this remake.I was not aware that this film was a remake of the book, ""The Last of the Mohicans"", but I liked the movie better.

The story of a group of Mohicans is one of the most complex and complex of all the Mohicans, and I found it quite entertaining to watch. I hope that this movie can be a part of my family film collection.I love this movie.  I have seen it several times. "

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam."

Having the ability to pause the water stream or stop it just by touching the spout or handle comes in handy whether you are washing your hands or doing dishes. You can save money with this feature. The faucet looks very good with nice styling. It comes with PEX hoses and very easy connection features. The faucet is designed for 4"" to 18"" spread between the handle and spout, but I do not recall that being specified in the advertisements. Our large single bowl sink caused the two to be mounted at opposite sides at the rear of the sink--20"" apart center to center. I soon discovered that the spout grounding wire and the LED spout indicator cable would not reach that distance. The grounding wire is a single conductor so it was easy enough to splice and solder some additional wire to span the distance. The LED cable is a three conductor cable with a jack and receptacle connection. To span the extra distance I purchased an extension cable from Radio Shack--designed for use with stereo connections/computer connections etc. The faucet works well, simply and effectively. No leaks."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

I had one as a kid and was thrilled when I saw they were remaking these and kept the look of the ones from 20 years ago instead of revamping the look like they do with all the remake toys. Sugar has very soft fur and I love the sparkly strands throughout her purple hair. The stitching on the dog is very well done and it seems durable.

Both of mine had 5 puppies so we were excited about that. Each puppy has a hard vinyl head with a soft body and a pink or blue bow around it's neck to determine if its a girl or boy. The puppies are about 4"" long and Sugar is about 15"" long. My niece's actually had a preemie puppy which was really cool! She was excited that there was a runt in the litter that was slightly smaller than the rest. I do wish the stomach hole in Sugar was a little deeper to accommodate all the puppies a little better but they do fit back in though it's a tight fit. They are very expensive on here and can be found cheaper at Target or Toys R Us. Simple but very fun toy and hands down their favorite gift this year!"

Alas, I don't have one of the Eye-Fi aware models that recognizes Eye-Fi in use, but I don't care. It's great to be able to have the pictures you're taking on an actual camera--the phone has a decent lens, but it's a phone after all--get backed up to my phone and being able to share that directly to the usual places. I'm also pleased with the speed of data acquisition, by which I mean the speed of the card in storing even large videos is great, the fastest card I have.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This Novella was pretty fantastic.  The Submission of Alistair Ingram really hit it out of the park for me.  This is the Story of Black Betty(Bethany) a Dom at Dolls and Doms private mens club in Vegas and Alistair Ingram movie star.  Allistair meets Black Betty at his Bachelor Party at the exclusive club.  He leaves with a torn shirt and red marks on his chest.  Courtesy of Black Betty of course.  His Fiance Heather is not too happy about this turn of events.  Engagement broken and Black Betty thrown into the headlines as the other woman.  The only thing wrong with that is Black Betty has been hiding from her ex.  Now she needs to get away before she is found.

  Now it seems to me that Black Betty(Bethany) has somewhat of a twisted past and she has been living as Black Betty to escape that.  Never confronting her fears or trusting anyone but herself.  Alistair on the other hand is a famous movie star and hasn't been able to dominate anything in his life as of lately.  So we find these two are more in like with each other than they want to be.  This truly is a story of facing your fears and moving on.  Learning to trust the one your with.  I loved Alistair more and more as the book went on.  Especially when he used his British accent.  How I love a British accent!  Black Betty too.  She was honest, brave, and loyal to a tee.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I did return mine - I have all tile floors with room rugs, and being semi-retired and self-employed from home I spend a lot of time in my slippers walking on the tile. The original cork built-up soles on the OG clogs are perfect for this whereas when I wear this Charisma with it's soft thinner sole in comparison it SEEMS I can almost feel the floor though the sole. That means not enough support for wearing them 10-12 hours a day every day. DANG it I love them and they were only $42 from Warehouse Deals....I do wish they had worked out! If you like the look I would encourage you to try them out and see for yourself how they feel. As a general house slipper, especially on wall to wall padded carpeting and just light use in morning, evening and weekends I bet they'd be GREAT.

DETAILS: Charisma is unmistakably a slipper (as opposed to a clog that could be worn as a shoe). Charisma has a snug fit - the size 42 for women's size 11 had my toe pushing right up at the top. Bear in mind one of my feet is 10.5 and the other 11 - the 10.5 foot thought the length was perfect. The fabric is very soft with some give and they actually felt OK even with my toes nicely wrapped up - for the 10 minutes I tried.  Like the OG clog style, these do have the molded foot bed with the slightly built up arch support. They are nowhere near as tough and stiff as the OG clog style; the sole is thinner and more flexible especially at the toes which are not bulbous and padded as are the OG clog style. The bottom of these soles are covered in thin ""grips"" that mildly keep them from slipping on tile so I would say these are not for use outdoors - much."

One of the  things I liked most is the vivid imagery conveyed by the author--much of it capturing the beauty of the natural world. I could almost feel the cool moist mountain air, smell the musty earth of a cave, the pungent scent from a stand of pines, and the sea spray at Chesapeake Bay. The author also has a great ability to conjure up emotions--some tender and sweet, others sad and melancholy. Suspense, too, anger, fear and a whole lot of nostalgia as his characters relive moments from their past, or as childhood friends fly kites and chase butterflies longing to fly. A thoroughly enjoyable collection."

Also, Dell makes it nearly impossible to find the software for this thing on their website. It is not detected by their support helper application and does not seem to have the ""service tag"" that is needed to find drivers and other software for your machine. There's tons of software to choose from one you do find it, but it's pure luck to download and install the correct software as everything is named the same and not labeled appropriately for specific machines and operating systems (it LOOKS like it is, but I have downloaded many packages for this device that indicate my specific laptop and OS, only to get a message that says :this software does  not work with this machine"" upon trying to install.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"this seemed like one of the more higher end dog food since it cost twice as much as the dog food I got the first time I got my shelter dog.. She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

I might give another brand besides royal canin a try (since it's so expensive...), but I'm going to stay away from the taste of the wild..."

I also bought the T20 version of this flashlight that I have had in the past. The T20 version is very compact and gives you a great light. I have also tried the T20 version with the T40 and T40-6 and I have had them both work as well as the T40-6. I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter. I had a few of these flashlights that I have tried but the T40-6 is very good for this kind of flashlight. I have had two of these flashlights that I have used for a few years and they are very good.

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"The new board (the one with the round boulders for spaces, vs. old board with squarish spaces) makes it just about impossible to exit the ""endless loop."" They have changed the placement of the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces within the loop--previously, landing on one of these spaces would (unless you got a minus 3) guarantee your exit (in addition to landing exactly on the exit space), meaning you have a significant chance of being able to exit the loop on any given turn. Now, however, the ""5"" and ""3"" spaces will never land you on the exit--so they are pointless! There's almost no chance of landing exactly on the exit space on any given turn, which DRASTICALLY lengthens the game. The game has gone from fun to FRUSTRATING. And isn't the whole point of this to make math fun??

Our ""solution"" to this so far has been to just ignore the rule of landing exactly on the exit space, treating the exit space as any old space and ignoring the whole loop idea. This makes the game super short, but that's better for my 4 year old and she still gets addition/subtraction practice without the torture of drawing the game out for hours. I may end up taking a sharpie to the board and changing the placement of the 3 and 5 spaces to where they are SUPPOSED to be, to make it more playable.

If Learning Resources will either correct their game board or send me the older version of the board that actually makes sense, I will update my review with additional stars, as I think it's a great game otherwise. How did this major flaw make it all the way to production?

Also, I noticed Learning Resources commented on another review recently, stating that the only updates they made to the board were artistic. That is patently false and is the difference between a one and five star game/review for me."
Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"I was given a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I really wanted to like this book. I thought it was a great premise and that the author was very creative in her world building. This is a book about triplets who are separated from each other at birth. On their 15th birthday their father brings them together and shares that they have a destiny together to save the world from evil.
Rise of the Trinity started out really well and had a great part in the middle, but overall it left me disappointed. There were several grammatical errors and typos. The wrong names in the wrong place, of instead of or, and similar mistakes. I found the timeline to be very confusing. When the book starts the characters are all teenagers. Midway through the book they have their 15th birthday. At times the reader is told in the narrative that years have passed, but the action would not indicate this. It might be helpful to mark the changing of time for the readers so that they are not trying to put the pieces together.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have attempted to use a bark collar 3 times and sent them all back for various reasons. This one is perfect. The charging system is excellent.  It has a rubber flap that stays secure when the collar is on. Many other don't provide this simple flap. The available setting, number 2, gradually increases the shock until the dog reacts. It is very humane because my dog knows how far she can take it. It allows her to still guard but with a little grumble, just enough to get her point across but stops her from the loud bark. She knows that when she has it on she is off duty.  She calms down immediately when it's on.  It did take consistent use, like any training, but I saw results within days.  I have used it now for 3 months and putting it on her is no big deal. The most important thing is that I don't feel guilty about using it.  She learned very quickly and only got shocked a few times until she understood her limits. It was hard to hear her yelp when it shocked her but I stuck to it and honestly, she learned quickly and the result is amazing. She never gets shocked any more when I put it on her.  It just helps her relax and keeps her in check. As long as she has it on the insane barking at delivery people, strangers, dog walkers, kids on skateboards, and other barking dogs has ceased.

The downside is that it's fairly large and I hate seeing that big box on her neck. But there is not getting around this. They are all pretty ugly. I tried a smaller one once. It looked better but didn't have enough power to work efficiently. Te only suggestion I have is to offer a few different colors instead of black."

The reason I took a star off is that the area where the hook connects to the top sphere is very loose. The whole toy pops off of the hook frequently with very little pulling, sometimes they fall off just trying to hang it in the cage.
In the end the bird still plays with it and he enjoys it, so it's not a super big deal.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"For YEARS I held onto my old kodak EasyShare, it was one of the first ever produced! I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade. My next camera will DEFINITELY be a kodak, but perhaps I'll wait a while and save my money to invest in one of their higher end cameras :)"

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"I could not take this book seriously after I read Chapter 1, The Myth of Calorie Math. The author quotes the study, Energy Density, Portion Size, and Eating Occasions: Contributions to Increased Energy Intake in the United States, 19772006 by Kiyah Duffey and Barry Popkin at the Univ. of NC at Chapel Hill, by saying that the study discovered the number of calories consumed per person per day increased by a jaw-dropping 570 calories between 1977 and 2006. The author of this book then goes on to state that if the average person is consuming 570 more calories than necessary per day and if the calorie-counting math we hear about daily is accurate, then the average person should have gained 476 pounds since 2006.

This is a misleading example and conclusion.  An increase of 570 calories (which I highly doubt in the first place), does not mean that the average person would gain 476 pounds! At some point, the weight gain would level out until the person reached a higher weight. In fact, the Chapel Hill study concluded that the average consumption was close to 2,374 calories/day in 2006 versus 1,803 in 1977. A human being will not weigh over 600 lbs. by eating 2,374 calories/day.

However, I do agree that these calorie studies are inaccurate, but not because calories don't matter, but because they're based on surveys, not science. The U of NC at Chapel Hill study based their information on an earlier study called, The Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), 1977-78, which was a telephone survey in which the person with major responsibility for planning or preparing meals reported on foods purchased the last 7 days, food consumption, a list of the people (age/sex) living in the household, and guests (who may have eaten food).

Books_5,4.0,OR,"So, I've never read any of Dimon's work, but the blurb had me SUPER interested to see what would happen. I have to say I was NOT let down in the slightest. Although this book was slightly slow to start, and it took me about 5 or 6 chapters to see the charm in Wren, the ending had my eyes bugged out of my head and my heart beating wildly.

Emery, I loved her. She was strong, compassionate, and dealt with Wren in ways I don't think I would have been able to (as much as I would love the smokin' hot scenes with him). I loved Garrett and his personality is all me! He's an amazing side character. Wren, of course I loved. His weird, non-humanesque traits made him endearing to me.

I most def recommend this book for anyone looking for something a little bit different. You won't be let down.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,First time using the Inov-8 in any kind of shoe and loved them. Grip is fantasitc and works perfect for all squating and OLY lifts. Good thing about this show is that they have more flex in the shoe which allows for use in different workouts as well.
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"Oh, gosh, I can't believe it's taken me this long to write a review.  Thought I had.  I've searched endlessly for a toy my dog wouldn't destroy (an entire stuffed monkey arm and a big red clown-like stuffed dog nose emerged intact from his butt, scarcely changed by the journey and thankfully without having harmed him.  Thought I'd found an answer with a couple of Tuffy toys, which he wouldn't touch and I had to give away.  But he's had this football for months and he plays with it from time to time and enjoys sucking on it. I guess that's the most I can hope for."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"As a child of the sixties and seventies, I enjoyed this throwback to my early years. The music references alone had me digging out old albums and throwing them on the turntable. Does anyone under 40 know what I'm talking about?

This is another--my 2nd read--complex book featuring Inspector Banks. Can't wait to read them all.

In this case, it's the search for the killer of a wayward man who simply couldn't get a break in life unless it was a bad one. The early story weaves in nicely with the present day lives of the characters who all played a part in what happens to the victim.

I particularly loved the young woman who befriended him as his student and whom he tried to help. She was very well-rounded and I hope she appears in some future book. All around, this was a real page turner. Good mystery, solved to my satisfaction."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"While this film ostensibly is based on an American novel, its plot and themes seem stolen from ""Martin Fierro,""  a 19th century Argentine epic gaucho poem.  There are plenty of beautiful landscapes and scenes of stampeding cattle to keep you visually entertained---in addition to pretty Gene Tierney and hubba-hubba-hubba Rory Calhoun.  Both wander around through part of the film with strategically torn tops that chastely communicate ""come hither.""  Calhoun is wooden as befits his role, and Tierney just sits, stands, and faints throughout the film, looking Gene Tierneyesque but not having much to do. Hugh Marlowe of ""All About Eve"" fame offers a lot of platitudinous talk of ""progress"", of the end of the barbarous life of the gauchos when confronted by the forces of the city (i.e.civilization).  This is a motif of Argentine history and a standard of Western fare.  See the flick and chalk if off as a Western set in the Southern Hemisphere."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I totally recommend this to Slash/yaoi fans. Vampires are the virus&curse type. Sean picks up a clever hitchhiker (Nick) that turns out to be a vampire hunter. Nick is looking to kill one of the original vampires to cure himself before he turns. Its a little cheesy but the two main characters really shine out. That and the type of vampire in the movie was intresting. I'm a big Sean/Nick shipper. :) The girls really more of a side character with few lines. The boys really only have eyes for each other.
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"First read from Emma Hart and it will not be my last. This book was just the pick me up I need after reading a lot of MC books. Mia and her friends were downright hilarious and the running commentary that Mia kept having in her head had me laughing out loud. West and his filthy delicious mouth was the type of alpha male that every woman dreams of. He let's you know what he wants when he wants it and is very confident in his abilities (with good reason).  Mia didn't think for one second that a casual hook-up with West would result into anything but the pleasure that he gave her. West was thinking the same but come to find out neither one could get the other off of their mind. When Mia finds out that she is now working for him she decides that it will be just business, too bad her heart, mind and panties didn't get the memo. When two people who can't keep their hands or mouth off the other and have gave up on relationships do is anyone's guess but if you'll like to see what happens PICK UP THIS BOOK you won't regret it."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Kammie & Luca, yes please!!! I was so excited to start this book and read about these two and Krissy V did not disappoint. This book is about Natasha & Fleix's best friends. Mr. & Mrs. no relationships. They have an instant attraction but do not want to be involved with each other because of their friends. They think it will just complicate a already complicated situation with Natasha & Felix, but their chemistry is too strong and situations too intense to break the bond they have. Instead it turns it from friends to lovers. The desire for each other becomes too much and they change their relationship! I absolutely love these two as a couple. The chemistry Krissy created between these two is amazing. You can feel it deep down. This is defiantly one of those books that just makes you happy!!! Can't wait to read what amazing story you come up with next. SO much love for this book!!"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"In the 21st book (of 32) of the Miss Silver series, the author not only uses her customary settings and characters (small village, lots of people with a keen interest in gossip, a pair of young lovers whose path isn't clear) but reruns some plot devices from previous novels in the series: someone returning after a long absence who was feared dead, someone asking for Miss Silver's assistance and failing to take her excellent advice, blackmail, an invalid who has nothing wrong but a desire to be catered to. This was written very competently in 1951 when the author was about 73 and had dozens of novels to her credit, so it's an engaging and assured read. I'm not giving it 5 stars only because of the retread plot devices. It's still interesting, and the young hero, Edward, is rather more romantically mysterious than her usual sort. Another aspect that is repeated (in a different manner) from the preceding novel is that Miss Silver, an elderly retired governess, is placed in danger. The earlier books kept danger mostly off-stage, with muted details reported at second or third hand. As the series progresses, though explicit violence is toned down, more action is permitted to be seen by the reader. As is often the case, the author makes the victims deserving of their fate and does not offer any positive sides to the bad guys. This is a weakness of hers, but it is in keeping with the Victorian morals of Miss Silver, a private enquiry agent who is the epitome of moral rectitude."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Well, I struggled a bit to write this review and I really wanted to give it 4 stars. But I couldn't in the end because I don't think that would be comparing ""Devil's Dream"" fairly to Bell's ""All Souls Rising"", a novel I find the richer and more moving of the two, and the novel to which I would attribute 4-5 stars.

""Devil's..."" is all in all a very entertaining, original and informative read. The story of Nathan Bedford Forrest is a truly fascinating one, and some of the literary tools Bell uses (i.e. the bits of ""magical realism"") add to that fascination . Some of the events in the first half of the novel regarding Forrest's family are powerfully done, e.g.the affairs Forrest had are described in a interesting, non-moralistic, human way; the death of his daughter is devastating..

But in the end, the constant chronological swings tired me. After loving the first 250 pages of the novel, I virtually flipped through the last 50. My sense was that what was described in those last pages had already happened earlier in the book (e.g. another horse shot dead from under Forrest after another heroic charge...). I had also grown tired at this point of trying to decipher Forrest's tennessee accent.

I remain an admirer of Smartt Bell. But ""All Souls Rising"" will provide readers a better experience of his talent"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is just like the V911 and V912 helos.  But bigger.  Significantly bigger.

Lots of purists hate this helicopter. They say its like driving a school bus. EXACTLY. If you're looking for a tiny agile helo to do cool tricks this isn't it. If you're looking for a big-boned helo that sounds awesome, that you can feel the wind from, that you can shred your trees and frighten your animals this is it. You can fly this thing very high and a long way away since you can still sight it due to its size.

Do not get this as your first helo. You need to know how to fly a V911 or V912 size first. This could seriously damage something (or someone) in your yard. Also, while this helo can take a reasonable beating, you'll damage it pretty quick if you don't know how to fly it. Heavier weight equals more damage. Also, you'll probably lose a helo in a tree (well, I've placed about 15 -- fortunately 14 were retrievable with a 20' ladder and a 40' fiberglass pole). Lose a significantly cheaper one than this."

The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern.

Like Gargoyles, Omega Man, The Devil's Rain and other genre flix from this period your memories will be fonder than the actual product.  This is a  good movie, and it makes me wonder what happened to Christina Raines.  The  movie benefits from a strong supporting cast, especially Burgess Meredith.  I wonder if Beverly D'Angelo lists this on her resume?  My only gripe with  the product is the lack of extras.  (All you get is the trailer.) I  recommend this film."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I love the look of the case. That is what drew me to it in the first place. The lack of space for optical drives didn't bother me one bit since I wasn't going for that anyway. Only reason it got one less star from me is because there is little space for cable management. Maybe I'm just not as good at cable management than I could be, but I just couldn't manage to route all my cables from the back. I'll keep working on it but then this is a smaller case."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Product feels heavy duty and well constructed. It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off."

She does not always get along with others, but she has a great respect for one another and her husband.  They live happily ever after and they do not see eye to eye with each other.  The main character is a strong woman who is very independent, but she is also very protective of her family.  She does not always like her husband, but she has a great respect for his job and the work he does.  They both have a lot of issues to deal with and I found it very enjoyable.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,These have been excellent as I've transitioned my storage containers ovefrom plastic. The lids are sturdy and do not leak at all. Love them.
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well."

It's very easy to clean and holds up well.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who uses a ceramic dog bed.  I've found that it is much easier to clean than the older one which takes a lot longer to come out.  I'm also very happy with the fact that my dog is still a puppy and the fabric is still soft.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win."

I also frequently catch the clip on my seat belt and bend it wide open. Leatherman has replaced at least 6 of these tools for me with refurbished ones. 4 stars because of the fragile jaws, otherwise I love it and use it multiple times daily."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"Overall, I really like this case. The rubberized outside feels smooth and sturdy and the pattern is nice, although not glossy as others have mentioned, which is fine with me. It feels like the case will be strong enough to protect my laptop from superficial scratches and such, but I'm not sure that it would prevent more severe damage with major impact, grantedt I don't expect much more given the very affordable price of the product.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use. One of the main reasons I purchased this case was for the keyboard cover so that it would reduce the clicking sound while I take notes in class and it definitely achieves that."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"The ""case"" is a little tricky to open at first but once you get on to it, is simple.  Like that it protects the lamp and takes up far less room than most Coleman's that come in a hard sided case."

Through the beautifully and simply illustrated tale of friendship between a cat and a dog (the interspecies metaphor alludes to openness and acceptance of differing points of view and experiences), we learn that material possessions and tangible items are sometimes not as meaningful as the space between two individuals, people, living beings, etc.  It is the unspoken, uncategorizable, sublime moments of life that are most fulfilling and rewarding, and the hardest to capture or describe.  Therefore, when trying to convey the depth of meaning of these moments, we cannot, and therefore, should not even bother trying (to encapsulate them, try as we may through photographs, video, blogging, etc.).  The best gift is one that one already has the power to give oneself--the gift of friendship, self-awareness/mindfulness and the ability to honor and nurture the two."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first camera case I have ever bought so I don't have anything to compare it to.  As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Fright fans, rejoice: thrills have been found again.

""Tales of the Dead: Grim Stories of Curses, Horror and Gore"" is an exploration of suspense. Divided into four vignettes, the film offers a variety of Halloween pleasures--each certain to impress those craving more than the standard cinema fare.

In this meet of multiple genres (each story chronicles a different element of horror, from the paranormal to the all too real) viewers will be offered a relentless pace and satisfying conclusions. The film does not falter as it changes tones and characters. It instead generates intrigue. This marks it unique among the typical plots. There are no tedious interludes or wasted moments. There is instead simply tension. It allows each individual to remain captivated; and this is a rarity.

What is not so rare, however, is the one flaw ""Tales of the Dead"" bears: its special effects. Like so many of its kind the film is limited by a too tiny budget. This forces occasionally laughable results and poorly constructed attempts at terror.

Those attempts are not enough to ruin the experience, however. While they may cause the viewer a momentary regret, they will still be countered by efficient storytelling and convincing acting--which offers far more than mere effects."

The other one is a bit too much about the humans. He is the most annoying character in the book.

The plot is in good shape, but it's not very good. There's not much of a plot in this book, and it's not very good either. There are enough bad guys to keep the book from being a good read. The story is all about the humans, and that's fine, but it's not really important.

I'm not going to tell you why this book was rated so high, because I'll just say that I found it to be a bit of a disappointment. The writing was good, but the story was too depressing to really keep my interest. It's also a little hard to keep track of the characters in this book"

The first disappointment was how it morphs the pictures. I tried using pictures I already had and then took new close up shots but none of the pictures looked too much like my daughter after they were turned into a cartoon. The shape of her face was probably the closest feature but overall I was disappointed because that is the main reason to buy this product. You child can make up a story on thier own and there are other free make you own story sites so the big hook was putting yourself in the story. I tried 2 of her friends, one with very distictive features and most family and friends could not guess which cartoon belonged to which kid. We decided to make a story with the best cartoon kid. I was surprised at the limited choices. My daughter was expecting to design her own dresses and accessories. There were 5-6 outfits to choose from and you had to wear the same outfit on each page. Printing out the story was easy. My daughter and her friends still colored then pages. Overall the product was easy to set up and use but i was not happy with the content.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"As a former sporting goods purchasing agent for Kmart about 15-16 years ago - when the first mass production of metal scooters were being imported from China - I can say that I've seen a few scooters in my lifetime. Some of those sample scooters lasted me until today - scooters my kids can still enjoy these days. This is a scooter with a great concept for power - it's all manual yet very simple to operate. The one big issue I have with this item that otherwise claims to hold riders up to 90 kg =200lbs(surprisingly, this is the same weight limit as the jr. model, which is aimed at 4-8 year olds) is the following: the plastic enclosure at the bottom of the scooter, the part that holds a wire and is close to the ground seems extremely fragile. I venture to say if a kid rides on the sidewalk and then decides to go jump on the street, that plastic piece could easily get smashed in the sidewalk corner, and render the entire scooter useless."

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"It appears that Arcos has skimped to make this a cheaper model. A MAJOR negative that the potential capacity is really a lot less than perceived. This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all. Skip this unit (however DON'T get a Ipod)."

It is big enough for two small kids (5 and 7 years old to play in it). We also tried filling it with 400 balls or so to let the kids to have another fun.
My son has low muscle tone, at first, he scared of playing inside. Then I used a candy reward to ask him jump inside to pick it, he then have fun in picking the candy inside the bouncer. So far, all the kids (less than 7 years old) who have come to our home enjoyed this bouncer.

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,CG,"Two of my four cats (Cats 1, 2, 3) love these treats!  They are so soft and absorbant, and they're the perfect size for a 4 pound cat. I can't imagine a cat would ever use them as a treat. The cats also love the peanut butter flavor, and it's a great way to keep their teeth clean. They're just not big enough for a dog, and they don't like a hard toy like a tennis ball. My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Chameleon is the tale of a planned alien invasion and an army team's effort to halt it. Although ostensibly part of a series, it is fine as a stand-alone story.
After an ominous prologue in 1925 we fast-forward to the present and to a military base located on an island from where a helicopter full of people destined for a mainland vacation takes off. Meanwhile, things go very wrong and the chopper returns to the island with all its passengers plus some military brass. From this point on the copter passengers are in a fight for survival against overwhelming odds. They can't possibly win ... or can they?
The book is well-written. Although I felt it was a wee bit slow in getting underway, when it did take off it was a whirlwind! The characters: plastic (in more ways than one), credible, with some likable and others less so - as in the real world. I definitely recommend this book!"

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My daughter seems to not get the hang of it.  She almost looks too big for it (she's 2) or the product seems to not inflate all the way (but we've inflated it to the max, where it seems like it's about to burst).  She falls off easily and doesn't bounce well on it.  I thought it would be like the videos but instead of bouncing up and down my daughter seems to lose her balance on it quickly.  Maybe it's just because when I first gave this to my daughter she was still trying to balance out having a large head (don't toddlers look like cute bobble heads, lol) but her balancing skills are much better now.  I'll try to give it to her again and see if she can play with it more now.  Before she would bounce and go flying off the thing but I think she's gotten more skills at balancing the past 4 months and will be able to use this more in the spring.  I like it because it's adorable and seems like it will be a ton of fun once she gets used to the concept.  She really does have fun on it the times I let her play but I always have to put pillows around her and be on alert in case she falls.  As she gets older though she'll have a blast."

I have had a lifelong love of anything 3-D (movies, comic books, View Master, etc.), plus I grew up during the '50s. This book, in my opinion, is a mirror on life itself (as well as life that has ended). I agree with the reviewer that wished the author had gone into some detail on finding and buying vintage photos. The sad thing is that most of the digital photos taken today will end up lost in la la land in the years to come, never to be seen again."

 I don't know if it would work as well for browsing and selecting things since it makes a small blunt sound as you touch the screen. It is annoying when pointing at things, but not there when sliding for writing and sketching. I bought spare points in case they are not available in the future. So far so good and I am loving it.

The tape they use it not the same VHB tape that I have. And I have 3M VHB, right out of the box, that I have used for years, so I know mine is legit.) These are not good for hard hat use. Two Cons...The holders are flat. There really is no flat spot on a hard hat, so there will be a small space along the edge that will not adhere to the surface. Its why Go Pro makes curved helmet mounts. Its a big deal, because enough of the VHB tape does make contact. Also, the holders are two different sizes. There is no instruction as to which goes where. I placed the large ones toward the back of the hard hat, and I hope that is correct."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"This is a good quality container and it looks good enough to have ""in the open"" in my kitchen.  The large container is very spacious, I typically buy 13-18 pound bags of food and they fit very nicely (I leave the food in the bag).  The casters are fantastic - being able to wheel this around makes it so easy to clean and keeps the container off the ground.  There are two things keeping me from giving it 5 stars, (1) the scoop is way too big and awkward and (2) the small container is always in the way when stored on top of the big container.  I have bought two of these; I use one big one for ""long term"" storage and keep the two small containers on top.  The other big one I use to hold the food my dog eats on a daily basis.  As for the two scoops?  Probably best for kids at the beach!"

The sound dampening is very good and the unit is comfortable to wear for long periods of time.  I expected the radio to be a poor performer based on other reviews, but found it to be decent for a shop environment.  A stand alone radio that I have been using has much poorer reception than this unit.  The nice thing is that you can actually hear the radio easily when operating large equipment (the shop radio was drowned out).  What really surprised me was the speed which Amazon delivered the product.  It arrived the day after shipping confirmation; that's great."

This book certainly falls into this category.  My only complaint would be the lack of a sequel.  Though the author ended the book in a complete manner, the story could very easily be continued.  Again, the sign of a good read is wishing for the story to continue on."

I don't ever really look at the screen while I'm running, and I can't imagine why anybody would want to.  I did however make sure I had a screen cover on my player to keep the plastic one on the armband from scratching.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We bought this for our new puppy.  He's a Pyrenees, lab, mastiff mix and he's huge.  We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he gets excited.  He's ten months old now and 120 pounds.  This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I Capture the Castle by Dodie Smith is an interesting book with multiple layers that can be appreciated by readers aged 13 an up. The book takes place in the 1930s, and it tells the story of a family living in a crumbling castle in England. The dad is a well-known author who hasn't written since his first book was released to critical acclaim in both England and the U.S. The narrator is Cassandra, the 17-year-old daughter. Rose, 21, Thomas, 15 and stepmother Topaz, completes the family.

With no income coming in, the family has gradually sold off all its furniture and other valuables until they are on the brink of crisis. When two young men from America inherit the castle next door,  it's no surprise that the family sees the men as their salvation in more ways than one.

The characters are all very complex, and as Cassandra writes in her journal, the reader watches them grow in many different ways. We see Cassandra grow from childhood to adulthood and take on more responsibilities. Some of the many things that can be discussed in a book club after reading this book: the changing role of women in society, love and marriage, the role of religion in our lives, money, children and their parents

I served tea sandwiches and scones for dinner to my mother-daughter book club, and everyone seemed to think it was a fun tie-in to the book. We talked about our favorite scenes in the book, and all twelve of us had a different one. I think that's amazing depth for one book. As we talked about what we liked about the characters, I also felt like I learned a lot more about each one.

The only criticism is that the book was a little wordy, and some people had a hard time getting into it. It also uses fairly sophisticated, complex language. With that in mind, I still highly recommend it."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,This series just gets better. I love the characters and the history. I would recommend this series. Great job!I liked this book but the writing was a bit slow. The story was a little rushed. I would read it again if I could. The author does a great job with the characters. I found myself rooting for the characters and I loved how they all made it through their lives. I highly recommend this book. I enjoyed this book. I love how the author wrote the story. I love the way the author moved the story along. I just wish there was more of a epilogue. This was a good read. I found myself wanting more. I found myself rooting for the heroine to get away from the bad guys. I like how the characters were in a better place. I liked how the story was told. I will definitely read the next one. I enjoyed the story. It was a quick read. I liked that the author didn't just draw me in.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Considering all the tools in my garage, this planer and the Dewalt 12"" sliding compound miter are the best investments I have made.  The only thing I am going to change is to put a spiral cutterhead in it.  If you have the wood bug hobby, this is THE planer to buy, short of a commercial machine.  I purchased this from Amazon on Jan 26, and it was delivered on Jan 30.  This is a good compromise of size and cutting capacity for a home or garage workshop.  I bought a dust collection adaptor to fit this to my shop vac, even though it says not to.  It fills up my shop vac pretty quickly, but it works.  I use very small increments of wood removal, and am able to get wood planed down to a perfect .500"" when measured with a dial caliper.  For fitting into 1/2"" cut dados, I couldn't be happier.  I've been using this on top of the table saw for a flat level surface, until I can make a sturdy wooden stand for it.  There are aftermarket carbide blades from Infiniti tools if you prefer not to double the value of the machine by buying a spiral cutterhead."

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"When we got our new puppy, we were told ""she's a chewer"" and given some rawhide chews for her. Those did NOT work. Our vet suggested we try a Kong toy for her, because they're made to withstand even the most heavy chewers. When we first got it, our girl showed little interest...but I read online that someone got their dog ""into"" the Kong by filling it with peanut butter and freezing it. I did this, and our little girl spent HOURS trying to get all of the peanut butter out.

I would say that the Kong is a great chew toy, but not on it's own. None of my dogs find it interesting in the least unless it's filled with something.  That being said, if you're willing to put something yummy inside of it, then you have yourself a winner most likely. We've tried peanut butter, pureed pumpkin, the paste they sell,  a combination of  peanut butter and carrots, and all has been successful. It takes a bit of effort, but our Kong is still going strong, and hasn't been destroyed yet!"
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Our little mini-beagle boy is a hyper chewing monster!  Every toy we get him gets destroyed in a matter of days.

It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is a charming movie with a great soundtrack and superb acting by Mel Gibson and Marisa Tomei.  Gibson reaches a peak of comedic genius in the movie, playing funny and compassionate moments with equal skill.  Although the movie's premise is rather absurd--a man who can hear women's thoughts after accidentally electrocuting himself in the bathroom--the viewer suspends disbelief and is drawn into the plot.  Marisa Tomei is hilarious as the ditzy coffee shop girl.  Delta Burke and Valerie Perrine, as well as Bette Midler, all have minor roles and are great in them.  Mark Feuerstein as Gibson's buddy is also excellent.  Some of the funny lines get a laugh from me every single time I watch (e.g., ""The poodle give you that one?"").  I loved the music, which included songs by Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, Cole Porter, and more.  This is a romantic comedy, and although I find it hard to see Helen Hunt as a vulnerable, romantic leading lady--I think of her more as the sardonic character in ""Mad About You""--I thought she acted well in the movie and even worked in some ""cupcake""-type moves.  This is a DVD whose extra features are worth watching, particularly director Nancy Meyers' comments on how the movie was made.  This movie is a keeper that marries the modern dilemmas of romance with the feel of romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s.  Mel Gibson's dance scene and the scene where he waxes his leg are outstanding, and he is entirely believable as the chauvinistic playboy who is shocked at what women think.  If you want to have fun watching a movie, this is the one for you."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"While our daughter is serving time in the US, we've tried a lot of different foods and we've found that the best thing for her to get through her food bowl is to go to the bathroom and look at the food in her bowl. If she doesn't like the food, she'll eat it.

Our daughter also loves the chicken and rice dishes. She has a tendency to just eat the chicken and rice dishes and that's fine because she loves the food. She doesn't like the chicken and rice dishes, but she does like the chicken and rice dishes.

Overall, it's a great bowl that doesn't have a lot of waste. It's a bit difficult to clean, and we're using the same bowl for our dog. It's also a bit heavier, so it's not the best for small dogs.

The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.

Published in the May 18, 2009 issue of The New Yorker. I enjoyed this book well enough. It is a fascinating story about the lives of three young people who have been separated for over a decade. I especially liked the fact that the story is set in the past. I was quite surprised to see that the author is working on a sequel to the book, The Lord of the Rings. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy or fantasy/thriller/adventure. I really enjoyed this book. I read it to a friend, and I enjoyed it very much. It is an excellent story about a family and how it all came together in the end. It is a story about a family. It is a story about a family."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Looks like these things sill last as long as I do. Sand in my area really requires that you stand on it some. Placed two of them into ground and not all the way to stop then hammered in two PVC rod holders. One of the PVC rod holders fell over after a couple of hours and I almost lost a rod. The aluminum rod holders held fast ever use.  There is also a ruler on the sand spikes.
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,CG,It was ok. About to go back and read the next one. There were a few typos.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"This is a great cordless saw. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver.

I had to replace the screw driver by myself. This saw is very sturdy and it came with a few tools. I would recommend it.I bought this to replace a broken"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"These are great. They are a bit smaller than I imagined, but they're the size of real measuring spoons so I should have known. They are great and look really nice on the counter!! Also came in perfect condition. I have the bowls and measuring cups to match and couldn't be more pleased with all."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,These are great - my dog has been eating them for a month now and they are still pretty healthy
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"I bought this for punching holes in the wall and using it to cut my nails. It has a nice smooth cut and is easy to use. The blade is a bit too long for my liking. I would not recommend this knife to anyone. If you are looking for a good blade for your project, this is it.

I had to order another set for my project. They are just great. They are not as long as the originals but still a good value for the money.I bought this for a friend who has a house, he loves it, and is very pleased with it.  It is easy to use and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the pocket clip. It is not very comfortable and I was worried it would be the only thing I would notice.  I will update this"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"I bought this #1 Beach Boot & I am very pleased with it. The heel is just right. The material is nice, soft and comfortable. I'm a size 10 so it's a little snug in the heel, but it's not really tight at all. I love it. I love the color and the fit. It is a little heavier than I expected, but I'm not disappointed. The only reason I didn't buy it is because I got a lot of compliments on it. I really love it and it fits great!  I'm a 36 and ordered a medium. It fits perfectly and looks great. I am very pleased with this purchase. Very comfortable and my son loved it!Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased with it. He is a 36 and wears a size 8. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. I love the fit. He has wide feet and this fit him great."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,My dog cant leave this cage. The only reason i gave it 4 stars is because the cage is so small.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is the second time I have purchased this film. I use it for my small round table education sessions on water.  It is worth watching, particularly for a quick lesson on transnationals and what it means to be priced out of water."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very good book for people interested in Russian culture and history.  The early part of the 20th century is seen through the eyes of a Russian nobleman who has become a ""non-person"" under the communist regime and he consigned to a tiny space in the attic of the grand Metropole Hotel in Russia, under house arrest.  How he overcomes his circumstances is the substance of the story."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My two gerbils roll around and get excited for this more than bath powder and other chinchilla dust brands. Some people have warned against using this because the dust can cause respiratory problems but my gerbils have used this for months with no problems.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Made for the Beretta recoil shooting vest, not for other use. One or two pads fit the vest fine and they definitely absorbs most of the recoil from a high-caliber rifle, but  I doubled up my pads to be sure. I often shoot at the range 100 rounds or so, and the Beretta Vest with two of these pads saves me pain and probably joint damage. Fully satisfied."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Definitely a good read. # teammoniandomega
I definitely didn't see that ending coming with jazz. I'm glad that tahani finally came to her senses but it was rather late."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I bought an xl for our 115 lbs Doberman. I first got him a large which he can wear but it doesn't fully cover his back and the underbelly strap is a snug fit. The xl is perfect! Our terrier also has one of these coats. They are thick and of excellent quality and with a reasonabale price.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,I was ill when the concert happened. It came as a surprise to me on cable tv a few weeks ago.  Missing the first half made me research the concert music and DVD.  I bought both and am glad I did.  this is more than a concert that was videotaped.
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,CG,"I remember seeing this as a kid and thought it was hilarious.  Well, I was wrong.  There was a scene where a girl and her dog fight, and it was pretty funny.  I still watch it a few times now.  This movie is still fun to watch.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedy.  I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.Love it!I was happy to get this film back on DVD, so I can buy it again.  I have seen it a few times since it was first released, and I enjoyed"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"i really, really like this cube. it turns pretty well. obviously, the best part about this cube is the hole in the middle of it. it definitely comes in handy when i'm trying to hold it and have other things in my hand at the same time because i can put the cube on my finger and make room for other things in my hand. the best way i found to solve this cube is this: R', D', R, D. Please Note: in order for this algorithm to work, the cube Must, Must, Must start in its solved state. otherwise, it won't work. however, if you start with it solved, you will need to do R', D', R, D  a total of 6 times and the cube will be solved again."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,I think its hilarious !! The birds are taking their time noticing it but will soon be ripping it apart like the last one.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I was slightly worried this would be cheap tape that wouldn't stick well, or would tear easily since it was such a great price. I was very pleasantly surprised with how nice the quality was!! I would definitely buy it again. When I'm looking for specific colors it's so much cheaper to buy it like this than to buy it at the store.

I would compare its texture and quality to that of the standard 3m brand tape you can find at lowes or Home Depot, but this is sooooo much cheaper."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,This book was so very excellent. To see what Dream has been through and she is able to push through is amazing along with Camryn and Cammile. These ladies are the images of what a strong woman can be. It just seems as life keeps throwing curve balls their way and the keep it moving...I hope their is a happy ending involved for all of them and they recognize their worth...can't wait for pt 2.

The story is well written and the story is very well told. The ending is satisfying and I would recommend it to
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,CG,Gave to Mother as a gift. The quality is good but it's not really the best one
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,CG,"As a fan of Eli Roth, I thought the film was a lot more interesting. I'm not a Roth fan, but I liked his film and the film was a great addition to my collection.

The movie is a bit slow and the plot was rather confusing. The film is mostly a story about a young man who has become a heroin addict and goes to rehab. He starts to live in a motel and meets a guy named John (Martin Sheen) who tells him that he's addicted to heroin. The guy tells John he's a drug addict. When John is in rehab, he makes a decision to quit. He tells John that he's going to be a heroin addict and that he's going to be spending the rest of his life in a motel. When John is in rehab, he meets a girl named Helen (Holly Hunter) who tells him that she's addicted to heroin. Helen tells John that she's addicted to heroin. John tells Helen that he's going to be a heroin addict and that he's going to be spending the rest of his life in a motel. Helen tells John that she's addicted to heroin. When John is in rehab, he meets a girl named Mary (Helen Novak), who tells him that she's addicted to heroin. Mary tells John that she's"
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This story, Unruly Hearts, really delivered the romance that I was looking for in spades. I found West simply irresistible, the combination of hot, handsome, well-intentioned neighbor struggling with awkwardly emerging lover along with a heroine who stars in this story for much more than her beauty was perfect. The love that grew between West and Annie reminded me of what my mother told me about love - when a man says he loves you when you look your best, it's a compliment, when he says it in the garden and you're covered in dirt, it's a declaration! In this story you also get a second romance, a mix-up on engagements, and a really nasty villain! Another thing I liked about this story was the strong female friendships that are too seldom found in literature. This story was well written and the story flowed well. The imagery was exceptionally well done; I could practically see, hear, smell, and especially taste the dust behind the cattle. The only false note in the story was Clara. I felt her hesitation about setting a wedding date didn't fit her character and her indecision about marrying West when she had feelings for Jones just plain felt wrong to me. That's why I gave this story four stars instead of five but even with this one flaw, it's still a very enjoyable romance with some graphic lovemaking but no vulgar language. (The reason I said ""lovemaking"" is there is nothing more than passionate kissing until West and Annie are engaged. ) For anyone looking for a historical western romance that makes you give a big smile at the HEA ending, then I definitely recommend this one."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,This has been one of the best jobs I've ever done. I have a large collection of tools and am very happy with the product.
Books_5,2.0,OR,"I grew up in a similar situation as this young lad is supposed to have grown up in- only it wasn't my mother who was a monster but rather my father.  I have great sympathy for the storyteller but I have to be honest and say that as a book, this piece of work is really substandard.  It makes for very boring reading and serves only to create the ""shock effect"" from all of the horrid things that are revealed.  This should not have been put into a book but relegated a short story in some magazine somewhere. Don't waste your money buying the book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"Not a kids' book, but very interesting read.  You have to suspend disbelief for the initial event, but otherwise everything follows naturally. The construction of the story (alternating viewpoints) makes you want--NEED--to keep reading!"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,It arrived on time and it worked. only issue is that it isn't that bright and my window is tinted(case window).
Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,CG,"I wanted to be sure that it was the best. I did not need a replacement vacuum, but I wanted one that worked. The attachments to the box were a bit of a pain to install, but it was a good value. The size was perfect and the holes were very easy to install. The bottom was a bit rough, but the holes were not that big so I could use it to put my nails in. I am very happy with this purchase. This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it was better. I put it in a refrigerator and it's working fine."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Like most uprights it is better on carpet than bare floors.  The suction is excellent and the unit and its attachments are well made.  It is very heavy when compared to canisters which makes it a little inconvenient to use in certain places, such as stairs. The other two drawbacks are clearance under cabinets and furniture are limited due to the large nose. Secondly, I find it necessary to buy OEM bags spending more than I anticipated.  The copies either are sized  wrong or missing a rubber seal and therefore decrease suction."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"Nice, they work and the price is right. We love this saw."

Books_5,3.0,CG,"I found this book interesting and educational, as well as a good history of the era.  The story is told from the perspective of a woman in the early 20th century, and the characters are well developed.  The historical background of the women is very interesting, and the descriptions of the relationships between the women are well researched. "
Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,CG,"These pants are lovely...great material, soft and comfortable.  The fit is nice and snug, but the stitching is so loose that it's a bit difficult to get out of the pants.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought these to hang on my iPhone so I can listen to music and books without all the tangled cords.  The first one I bought worked so well I bought 4 more for friends.  Word of advice....when pulling the earbuds out, first put the other-end plug in the hole of your device and then pull on the earbuds end.  (Don't hold onto the rolled up part of the spool and pull just one end.)  I love the price!  And they're good looking too, and comfortable in the ears.  The audio is just fine.  I will definitely recommend them to others."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,Best. Toy. Ever. We put his meals in it and it keeps him going for half an hour.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I bought the black version and it is the best. I will keep this in the car and use it when I go hunting. The only negative is the plastic part. The plastic part is just a little hard to get on and off. I wish it was stronger.The pump does not work as well as I expected.  I have had to replace it with a new one.  I just went with the old pump.  The new pump works great.This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and easy to use. The mount is not too big, and it is easy to use. I would definitely recommend this to any camping friends or family.This is an awesome product and I was very impressed with the quality of the product. I'm happy with my purchase.Works great on my Trek saddle. I have the 4 wheel version of this saddle, and the saddle is a bit of a pain to get on, but it is a great product. I wear this saddle daily, and have not had any issues with it. I would recommend this saddle for anyone.This is a very nice bike.  I was looking for something that I could ride on, but I just didn't like the size.  The fact that it had a small wheel makes it very hard to ride, which is nice for a child.  It is very lightweight, and I would definitely recommend it for a beginner bike rider."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Kingston 16 gig Data Traveler is a great all around memory stick to have on hand. It is fast enough to copy data to and extract from for everyday use, even large files. I keep 2 on my desk just for file transfer and to use for everyday tasks. Very easy to use and  all computers see them quickly and load them on command. The swivel lid is a nice option as well as I am always losing the caps. I have never had trouble with Kingston memory and will continue to purchase them from Amazon. Nice price, got here in 2 days, great product and great buy."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,My cat is so picky. This she loves! Please remember this IS AN APPETIZER! She will eat this and will still be hungry. It is good for when she won't eat her regular food. I give her this food first thing in the morning and she is usually back to eat in one hour.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Awesome my son loves it. This thing is very useful especially to build up speed.
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,CG,"Unnecessary Nudity, I think the writers should have let the audience know that they need to be careful about what they are reading. The movie is a bit too graphic and the dialogue is very contrived. The only reason I bought this film was for the ending. This is a great movie for the fans.I love this series!  I love the fact that it is a comedy!  I love the fact that the writers chose to go for the more ""realistic"" look of the series!  I love the fact that they included a lot of extras for the DVD!  This series is a great addition to any collection!  The actors are fantastic!  The show is filled with good ideas and fantastic plots.  The stories are amazing and I can watch them over and over again!"
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,CG,"I bought this after our old ones had broken and it was a nice piece of equipment.  It is so easy to use and the attachments are very easy to use.  I used this to make a little bread in the oven, then it was ready to go.  The bread is so easy to clean and it is so easy to clean.  It is a little heavier than I expected, but it works very well.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it was a bit too small for the little bread I made, but it was perfect for the baked bread I made.  It is definitely worth the money.I bought this as a gift.  I had some other candles and this one does the job perfectly.  It is a bit smaller than the ones that I have, but the candles are great for the price.  I wish it had a larger size.  I have a small apartment in my house and this one does the job well.

Electronics_5,1.0,CG,"I bought one of these and it works fine.  I will keep my review in order to share my experiences.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to be a little heavy for such a small item.  It is a bit heavy for a non-small item, but I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I'll update this review if I find any flaws.Works great. I used it to make a sketch on my kitchen floor, and it worked great. The size is perfect for the laptop. I don't have any issues with it.I'm using this on my Galaxy Tab S7 and it's a great little device.  The sound is great.  The apps are very good.  The screen protector is very nice.  The screen is thin and lightweight.  I would definitely buy this again. "

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,Love these pants!  So comfortable with lots of room.  I have purchased 4 pairs of these pants over the last year or so and they are by far my most favorite dress pants.  They look great right out of the dryer and sheds wrinkles easily.  The expanding waist is very comfortable and the pleats are very professional looking.  These pants also breathe well and stay cool on warmer days.

-expensive

Thoughts

Not having at least 4 LAN ports is a big negative for me given the price tag, but I think I might be able to overlook that given the powerful processor and increased range it provides. This is clearly a business class device that is packed with advanced features. If is worth the money, but is more than most people need."
Books_5,4.0,CG,"True to Kay Arthur's study of the relationship between the two characters. There is a strong connection to the two characters that is often missed by many readers, and the author is very clear that it is a relationship between Kay and Stephanie, both of whom have come to terms with their feelings for one another. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of it. Kay is determined to get Stephanie out of the relationship with Kay, and Stephanie is determined to get Kay out of the relationship with Kay, and Kay is determined to get Kay out of it. The story is not only about Kay, but about Stephanie, and the book is full of both of them. There is a lot of action, and a lot of twists and turns, but it is not the most compelling story. My only criticism of the book is that the ending was a bit abrupt. There was a lot of tension in the book, and the ending was not unexpected. However, the plot of this book was well paced, and I was very excited to read the next book in the series. I have never read a book that was so abrupt that I felt like I was in a story."

It was also unique and had a pleasant storyline, romance, passion, and wonderful character development.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Don't let the manila fool you, this is a comfortable and soft rope. The braiding is tight and the quality excellent. There is little to no fear that it will fray into your hands, the way some cheap manila ropes will. The 1.5"" diameter is perfect for my children to grip, and is also good for adults. The rubberized coating on the end should last a while if we keep it from dragging all over the ground.

Compared to synthetic/poly climbing ropes bought by some friends (on Amazon), it is much easier to hold and grip. It's not slippery like they are. I think this one is much safer for the little hands.

At the end of the day, it's a rope you toss over a tree limb to climb and swing. But it's more quality than I expected for the price."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I love the concept. I found some of the stories more engaging than others. The problem with short stories is that there's sometimes not enough time to care about the characters and really feel their despair and visceral urge for revenge. ""Until Death Do Us Part"" was most effective, because everybody can empathize with a bride on her wedding day. The BPD reception was something I'll never forget! Probably everyone can relate to the road rage sketch and will enjoy living vicariously (and laughing in shock) through the fantasy. ""The Proposal"" was a little too long--the least satisfying and most boring of the tales. Revolved mostly around greed and entitlement, which don't interest me. ""Pasternak"" was interesting but too unlikely to make a serious impact (no pun intended). ""Rats"" was pretty good. The one about the demolition guy was okay. Honestly, I might give this 3.5 stars. But I'm not at all sorry I rented it."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Any drummer who wants to learn great technique or merely enjoy great drumming will appreciate this video. It showcases Buddy's technique across a full spectrum of sets, including brushwork on ""Brushstokes"".

One of the highlights of this DVD is a bonus sequence of ""Green Dolphin Street"" (from 1972) that has one of Buddy's classic solos.  This sequence alone makes the DVD worth getting. An added bonus is the included soundtrack on CD that comes with the DVD.

For the drummer wanting to learn a few tricks this is one of the best viedos of Buddy because there is ample camera exposure on his playing.  It's one thing to listen, but when you can see and listen it's a powerful combination for learning technique - and this video does just that.

Tracks include Hookin' It, Brush Strokes, If They Could See Me Now, Good News, West Side Story Medley, Carioca, Time Check, Green Dolphin Street.

If you are a Buddy Rich fan I also recommend getting the CD ""Buddy Rich Collection"" ASIN B00000DB1H, which is a remake of a 2-record set circa 1971."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

In future I may try some of the competing low priced 'toothpicks' from companies like Boker, Columbia River Knife and tool, and Frosts ""Steel Warrior"" series."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well."

The dynamic between Ellie, Drew, and Jason was very interesting.  I felt bad for her being caught between two of the most important men in her life.  I found Jason and Drew's interactions to be fascinating .  There is a lot of history there and it made for some tense moments as well as emotional ones.  However, only part of it was shared and I'm hoping we'll get more if/when we get Jason's story.

He is a big fan of the Casio leather shoes, but he loves the extra length.  The reason I got this is because I don't like the ""gleaming"" effect of the leather.  I wish the sole of the shoe was a bit longer, but overall I like the leather.  I wear a 9.5 and my 9.5 fits perfectly.  I bought a 9.5 in black and it's perfect.  I also like the extra width and it's very comfortable.

I wish the leather were a little thicker, but not too thin either.  The leather is very soft and comfortable.  The material is thin and holds up well.  I'm 5'2"" and these shoes are a little long for me.

I'm not a doctor and I just read the book, so I haven't yet started the program, but McWayne has a very logical and well thought out approach that is clear, concise and appears to be quite effective. And McWayne  matches his simple approach to weight loss --  based on psychological principles and medical research -- with obvious passion that should help get you started on the program.

An absolute page-turner.

I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase."

There are quite a few varied exercises to try and they are easy to learn. It seems that the focus is on the upper body so I'm not sure you'll end up looking like the people pictured on the box. Still, it's a fairly intense workout and certainly makes a welcome change to using the machines at the gym.

My only criticism is that you need a considerable amount of space to really use the rope effectively.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I am a young teen who recently read this book and I personal believe that  this book is pretty innocent compared to the ""The Big Nate"" series. It Has intelligent humor unlike the big Nate series too. there is not a lot of disrespectfulness of other people in this book and it dosen't have bad messages unlike big Nate. The reason I am comparing it to big Nate series is because I am aware that both books are very popular and funny, but I have read big Nate, and i would agree that it has a very bad message, with unintelligent humor, and many inappropriate scenes. I would prefer children reading diary of a wimpy kid more so then the school drop-out who likes to skip school big Nate. In diary of a wimpy kid the main character is not a school drop-out But does talk a little bit about girls, but not a lot. Diary of a wimpy kid deals with some problems that people may face in real life in the dramatic middle school, like problems with friends, bullying, and looking ""cool"",  but the author took these problems and added some funny spice to them to make it a Funny novel that children can laugh at and say, ""I know exactly how he feels, but how did he deal with it? I think i am going to read on to find out."" this book is a great and funny series that is overall innocent and deserves only the best. It makes children want to read the addicting book. It takes problems people face everyday and turns them into a laughable story. I would suggest this book to all ages."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I loved this when I first got it, easy to set up and looked great!  After a couple of days of suspicious distrust, they tried and and liked it. It became the favorite.  But after about 6 months the plastic piece that holds the hinge pin broke.  I tried to use it with just the one hinge but it was obvious that it would break too. They are made of plastic. For a litter box that cost almost $100 I would expect hinges that were made to last.  Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side. But after the hinges break and the door comes off it is not so attractive, have included pics. Will be moving to a bigger house so will need another litter box. I think I'll look at some other ones."

What really made me love this Author more is that the Editing that was done, was done with the utmost care, so that the flow and ebb of the story was so smooth that you read 'The End' too soon.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I had compared the dimensions on the site to a fleece jacket I had and the Condor came up a little short (less than 1/2 inch though) in each dimension compared to the fleece dimensions.  I ordered the 3X (there is no 4X).  It is a nice jacket, I just do not like the way it drapes on the body.  The Spandex does not really allow it drape anyway.  I am 6 feet plus and about 260 pounds.  It does fit snugly but I think it is really the Spandex.  If I could relax the Spandex a bit, I would really like this jacket.  I love the number of pockets, especially the fore arm pocket.  I use it for my ID card.  I love the hood with the visor.  I wear it to work over a tee shirt and polo shirt normally.  I would say it would be comfortable no lower than the high 40s F by itself.  You could extend that if you wore a fleece or sweater underneath.  It is more comfortable in the 50s F though.  I have worn it in some pretty good wind and rain storms.  Wind intrusion is not a problem.  So far, the rain has not penetrated the material either.  The slash pockets are a little high up for me though.  It could be an inch or 2 longer in the overall length.  It could also be a bit more packable.  I wanted it to roll up in the bottom of my work back pack for when I travel.  Does not really lend itself to that though."

For me, Riding It was an easy read. I didn't need to read the full length story. It was a little slow to get into the story. I wanted to go through it in one sitting.

Also, I have a Dish HD DVR and I was able to use this hard drive to expand the storage space of my cable box. This was really worth the money.

I have this hard drive in a safe spot so it doesn't fall or get bumped. Im not going to test its durability, but any hard drive will become damaged if its droped so be carefull."

I have to say I'm a bit disappointed. The colors were not as seen in the pictures. It looks more yellowish that orangish. Which makes it look cheap and more like a knock off.
I tried to fit it in the Lego minifigue dispay case, but it was pretty hard to fit since there is a hose coming from his backpack tank, and the front one is long too.
In conclusion I like this guy, but not a big fan of the color the colors. If I could I would paint it."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Kids enjoyed building the toys, and had minimal frustrations, but there is little fun after the initial build.  It does not necessarily encourage free thinking and creativity nearly as much as other building toys, but it is a good starter set for that type of thinking.  After done, you are kind of stuck with two big toys that don't do much beyond standard toys that are already built.  Not knocking it really, but just how my kids work.  I think at this price, there should be more creative thinking."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a dark, dark book, so be forewarned before you pick it up. Ben Boswell deserves a lot of credit for going places a lot of erotica writers wouldn't and looking unflinchingly at what he finds there. Daniel is an interesting character, all suppressed needs and desires, something he only truly learns the hard way. This is not a romance, like a lot of erotica these days, which is a good thing to me. I'm always interested in people who are trying to expand the genre in a credible way. If you like your erotica with an edge to it and like crime fiction, this could be the book for you."

We got this for our dog to use as an on/off leash. It works great on him. He is a chewer. He's a medium-size dog and he loves this collar. It's easy to put on, holds the dog well, and is easy to use. It's well made and has a nice handle to hold the dog's head. I was able to find some of the sizing information on the package, but my dog doesn't seem to mind it. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to change the sizing information, but it's just good enough. I'm very happy with it. I would recommend this collar to anyone with a dog who is a chewer or chewer and/or chewer."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"In ""His (A Dark Erotic Romance Novel)"" we meet Kat and Gavriel. Kat is a college student who is working at the college library and is dared to kiss the first hot guy she sees, which happens to be Gavriel. This dare leads to her following him home and witnessing something no one was ever meant to witness. Admitted serial killer Gavriel doesn't expect to see the young woman who kissed him out of the blue at the library to be peeping in his windows and interrupting his pre-meditated murder, but when she does he has no choice - he has to keep her or kill her.

The plot had an interesting twist to the normal kidnap dark romance, which I enjoyed. I enjoyed both characters and liked that the author told the story from both POV. The chemistry between the characters was hot and the sex scenes hotter. This story hits a nice balance where it is dark enough that it should satisfy those with a interest in dark romance, but not so dark as to turn off the regular romantic suspense readers.

Overall, a recommended read."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,I normally wear an x-large for all the T-Shirts I have purchased from Adidas and others.  This shirt felt like a medium at best
Books_5,5.0,OR,This years favorite book. I really wanted to understand life in Kentucky and the exodus to the midwest and the problems in the area after coal left so many people without jobs. This is an important book for Democrats to understand why people voted for Trump and a way to have more compassion for those coming from Coal country. I don't want to give more away but this shows the situation in a compassionate loving way about family and their strong bonds.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,Well made product for Jake & neverland pirates fans. No complaints. Their bodies twist. They're about 2-3 inches tall.
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,We gave up on this one about 30-minutes in because it was billed as a comedy and we didn't find it humorous and the woman doing the documentary was too hard on the eyes. We came back to it a few weeks later and it got much better though the hair and face on the woman doing the documentary didn't get any better. The way Leslie sets up his night of murder is worth the price of admission and it explains almost every horror movie that has a group of people in a place where they will be killed off one by one. There is some humor in it and its a dark comedy that Im glad I didn't totally give up on.
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,Wonderful product! Giving your best friend an easy way to thank you is a lot easier!Very nice.I bought this for a friend who has a small dog and it was great.

Linda is a strong character and she will do anything to for her son. His happiness is what she wants and when an old love comes back into town, Linda knows she has to tell him the truth about Mac but it won't be easy. I really like the way Linda grew within the pages of this story. She started out shy but she found her true inner self. I loved the way Dave wouldn't give up on what he wants and that is getting to know his son and getting to realize Linda all over again.

The sex was hot but there wasn't a lot but the scenes that are in here, made me sweaty just reading it. This book is so worth the read!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Testing this as a free product from the Amazon Vine program.
Space age looking, and heavier than most standard claw hammers, but easy to use and swing with less shock than a wooden or straight plastic handled hammer.
Like others I have noticed some nicks and scratches after very little uses so suggest the steel is a little softer than it should be maybe.
At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley. Aside from the magnetic nail channel (great feature) I don't see a huge amount to justify the price. It does have a lifetime warranty, but then again it should at the price. I was generous and gave it 4 stars."

How do you begin a new live when your name is not your own and you end up wherever you end up, not necessarily a place of choice? So many times we ask ourselves why does a woman stay and this book really does explain why. I have so much empathy and compassion for women in this position. It boils down to being a no-win situation to some degree. While some people did not like the ending, I did. I thought it was realistic and really does capture what's there at the end of the road."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"Only a portion of this film is devoted to the actual rendition of the Water Music, and only a bit of the portion at that. The greater part is focused on the preparations for producing this would-be recreation of the original performance, intended to enhance George I's public relations battle with his son, the eventual successor as George II. The English Concert under Andrew Manze is recruited for the original instrument performance, and they are decked out in period costume -- with the women orchestra members in effect posing as men and the men who have facial hair sacrificing that to the barber's blade for the sake of authenticity. Acoustical tests are performed on the river to gauge how everything will sound outside the concert hall, and a suitable barge reminiscent of those of three hundred years ago must be found to refurbish. In the end, everything comes off, more or less. To call it a full recreation is a bit of an exaggeration, however. The barge must be towed by a modern tug, rather than propelling itself by means of oarsmen. Moreover, the musical barge is more or less on its own, unlike the original performance, where many personal barges accompanied the king to Chelsea for his meal and then back, serenaded all the while. Indeed, as the barge proceeds along the Thames and into the night, few people on shore appear to really notice what's going on. The performances that are heard are certainly fine enough, and the sight of the musicians playing in early 18th Century garb is fun, but in the end I thought the documentary fell just a little flat. Interesting and worth a watch, but not a huge thrill."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I finally bought this after year-before-last's annual ""fight with the bird"", and am very happy I did.  This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far."

This is a fun exciting story with amazing characters and world written by the author. She really know what she is doing with this series. Lots of twists and turns in this story as well as corruption. You just don't know who you can trust and who you can't. There are references to sex as well as sex scenes in this story. Got to see some of the people from the previous stories and got to meet some new ones, who hopefully we will get more about or their own book in the future.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this an an everyday carry light to keep in my pocket. This flashlight fills that role nicely. 120 lumens is plenty of light for walking down a dark alley, or finding items in my car at night, it is even bright enough to use as a tactical flashlight for close range use. Full power mode will allow you to see quite well at 25 yards while medium power in excellent for situations where you don't need 120 lumens, such as walking the dog. Low power mode is excellent for tasks such as unlocking a door or reading. I could live without the strobe as I don't have much use for it.

The ergonomics of this light are well thought out. The checkering allows for a secure grip, but it isn't abrasive. Furthermore the tactical style bezel is rounded out enough to avoid abrasions and scrapes to the user while being aggressive enough to get the job done. Perhaps the best feature is the power switch, as it is well thought out. Press the button slightly for momentary on and press the button until it clicks for constant on. Once the light is in constant on mode, a half press of the button will switch to medium power, another half press for reading mode, and yet another held press for strobe. When the light is turned off, it will reset to full power the next time the light is turned on.

Perhaps my only complaint (a small one at that) is that the light makes a high pitched whine when on medium power mode. This is only noticeable when the light is near your ear.

Overall, I would recommend this light for everyday carry use because it is well thought out, built with quality, and above all else it is reliable."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I wanted to try this vacuum out in my home and I find it okay but nothing to brag about. Suction appears good and it picked up everything we threw at it, including pet hair, sand, dirt and dust just fine.  This is my first ""swerve"" type vaccum so it took me a few days to understand how to make it go where I wanted it to go.  I also liked the fact it has a HEPA filter to prevent dust from escaping from the unit back into the room. It also comes with a very long cord, and the dirt canister or cup empties from the bottom into the trash, which seems to lead to less dust getting back into the air for us.  But there are some drawbacks.  There is no headlight or height adjustment feature and this unit is difficult to push over carpets. Clean any good size room with carpets and you will feel as if you have been at the gym doing push ups.  The unit does a great job on hardwood and tile floors however and I would certainly recommend it for that.  This unit is also relatively quiet compared to my other vacumms.  You can use it without waking up everybody in the house and I like that.  You can also detach the unit from its base and carry it to clean stairs, etc.  This is not a good unit to try and clean small area rugs however as the suction is too great and it simply picks up the rug.  The handle of the unit can be adjusted up or down to fit your desire and also lifts out.  When you lift out the handle, attach the hose to it and the provided attachment, you can use it to clean higher up areas like drapes or window sills."

First Class is the missing link that will answer questions for the fans of the movie, who don't follow the comics, and it is one blockbuster film that more than lives up to its hype. From the special effects to the make-up and finally to the actors this film is amazing. Movies like this never win awards, but you will be hard pressed to find better performances than those of James McAvoy, Kevin Bacon, & Michael Fassbender. The whole cast was terrific, the story was fantastic, and the special effects were truly out of this world. This is a great film and I'm craving more. I can't wait to see what connections the next forty years bring between first class and the trilogy. When it's all said and done, I hope I can watch all these films and truly understand the whole story."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had to laugh at the antics of the main character, Aiden, to woo Katie over. He was relentless in getting her to admit that she loved him and wanted to be with him. But through it all he knew Katie better than she knew herself it seemed. He was caring and did things to help her and she didn't know, she just thought he was being annoying and pestering her. I think Katie secretly enjoyed the back and forth that took place between herself and Aiden.

I liked how the book weaved some of the history of the Cheyenne into the story. It showed the struggles that were faced back in the day and how you cant judge someone by first appearances. You never know what secret that might have and it could surprise you. I thought the book was well written and seemed to be one of the better books so far in the series.

Overall I enjoyed this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series to see how the other characters fared."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Kylie Mitchell is one of the few humans left on earth after a nasty experiment took out half the population. She runs a vampire bar in a town filled with supernaturals. There is a council that matches soul mates. Kylie never anticipated being matched by The Council of the Wise because of her human status but she was matched.

Christian a werewolf and Michael a Vampire are Kylie's mates. Kylie has no wish to be mated at all but she cannot deny the blazing attraction between her and the two handsome men. While Christian and Michael can barely stand each other they both have intense feelings for Kylie. When the council pairs the trio, Christian and Michael are willing to do anything including working together to win Kylie's heart and body. Can they capture their soul mate or will they lose her to an evil fate first?

The Twisted Kiss is a hot and thrilling novella. I really like the premise of the society being built by Anya Bast in The Twisted Kiss. The dark and gritty world left after Doomsyear is compelling and full of sexy paranormals. Kylie shares exceptional chemistry with both of her men and when the triad is together the pages melt with their combined heat. I look forward to learning more about this exciting world and the people in it in the next Doomsyear novel.

She is one of a motley number of new recruits who include a vampire, a troll, an Igor, and seveal other rather strange people.  They are looked after by the mighty Sergeant Jackrum, who keeps a fatherly eye on them all.  Polly soon finds out that she is not the only recruit with something to hide, and learns the importance of an extra pair of socks.

She finds herself acting as batman to the nervous Lieutenant Blouse, who dreams of achieving glory by having an article of clothing or food named after him.  The war is going badly for Borogrovia, and the enemy are getting the upper hand, but then the recruits devise a cunning plan for snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.  But Maladict the Vampire is having coffee withdrawl symptoms, and Wazzer is hearing voices in his head, and things are getting stranger all the time.

There are some good characters in this book, particularly the larger-than life Sergeant Jackrum, and some chracters from previous books pop up.  It's not quite as sombre as 'Night Watch', but it is a bit short on laughs compared to earlier Discworld novels, there are some funny bits, but they are rather few and far between.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"This is a perfect example of CGI taking over.  It's obvious someone drew up a storyboard with a dozen action scenes and another dozen tense lines.  There may have been vague intentions to add in credible plot details and character motivations before the actors arrived.  Time apparently ran out.  This Lex Luthor is the weakest villain of all time...just incredibly bland and flat.  The actors are given so little to work with that scenes must be propelled with clenched teeth, furrowed brows, and pained brooding.  None of them seem like they could have possibly had a minute of fun in their whole lives.  The color palette is dreary and limited.  The musical cues are mind numbingly predictable.  The camera angles are never inventive.  Except for a couple of new visuals, it's so much of the same old same old.  That's unforgiveable considering how many actors have now played Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent.  If either of them show up in some other form or fashion I would beg Hollywood to stop any and all references to their past.  It's becoming a xerox of a xerox."

All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.

This is were Elizabeth forms a plan to sell her virginity to the highest bidder. This is also were the excitement begins. There are so many levels to this book. It is part romance, erotica, mystery, and suspense.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"You're at a party.  Or maybe you're at a work event.  And somebody spends the night trying to convince you of who they are.  They're trying to convince you that they are honest or highly creative or a really, really involved parent.  To paraphrase the bard, ""I think thou tries to prove themselves too much.""  Whenever someone tries hard to sell themselves, to sell you on a notion of who they are, they are almost always never that person.  That's all you can take away from one of those ambushes with any certainty.  Why do I bring it up?

This book is the exact opposite experience.  Brett is never trying to convince you of anything.  Story after story, she is nothing but humble and candid.  It's really what elevates the book.  It never reads too preachy and she never claims to know anymore than what her experiences have brought her.  And, so many of her lessons come from those she has watched and studied over the years.  Her time spent as a reporter works so nicely in this book.  She is in every story, but never demands the attention or the spotlight.  And, she never once tries to turn this into an ""issues"" book.  She mentions her own terribly troubled past only when necessary and only in the increments needed to move the story along.  This, I think, allows her own quiet yet clear voice to shine throughout.  Simple, yet elegant.  She must be one heck of a lady.  She never tries to convince me of it, but it's what I walk away with.  Nice, nice piece of writing.

I put it on my cooktop and let my big hood suck away any odors.  It heats up quickly and the food has always come out great.  We made donuts after cooking shrimp and halibut with no cross-odors or tastes!  My family only tolerates fish, so this was greatly appreciated.

Cleanup is easy also.  After waiting for the oil to cool, the pan, lid and rack can go into the dishwasher.  Only the heating element has to be cleaned by hand and it is quite easy.  The oil can be used many times without problems and so it is more economical to use than I originally thought it would be.

I would recommend this with no caveats."

When I found out that it was coming out on DVD (Only like a month ago), I almost cried with joy. This is truly a wonderful TV show, animated or not, and it's finally getting the attention it deserves. Zim, the overly determined and somewhat crazy invader who just wants to prove himself worthy in a world where he is isolated, can be compared to many of us who are just trying to make our mark on the world. Gir, the lovable and fun-loving little robot, is like the child that lives within each of us. Dib's obsessive beliefs and theories relate to the things that we try to hold on to in the chaos we call reality. And Gaz is the anti-social, shadow-loving girl who we can relate to on really annoying days when people won't leave us alone."

There are many Star Wars figures from the original trilogy and a few from Return of the Jedi, but none have made it to the movies.  This one is great, but I wish there was more.

The helmet does have a ""top"" that makes it easier to stand, but it's a little too small for my 3.5 year old.  I would've liked a bit more realism, but I don't think I'd've been able to use it in a pose"

My biggest gripe, though, is that the cushions don't hold the stock or barrel well. I built a rifle rest out of lumber and cut much deeper V notches to hold the weapon in place. The Caldwell cushions are much too wide and low. I have yet to find a rifle or shotgun that is comfortable in this rest."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"Purchased this for my adopted puppy. He was 10 months old, and over 90lbs when we got him. He came from a neglectful home, had never walked on a leash and was not trained at all. He pulls a lot on the leash, and is a jumper. A regular collar and leash was not cutting it. The only attention he got at home before was when he jumped up on his owners, which he did to us, then got him over excited and he began to mouth and nip. At almost 100lbs, this normal puppy behavior did a lot of damage.
This product is well constructed, and good quality. It comes with an instructional DVD as well. However, I followed the DVD, and eased him into sizing and wearing this, gave him lots of love and treats during the whole process. He seemed fine with it and I tried having him wear it for a couple seconds at a time and went from there. He didn't seem to have a problem wearing it. However, when it came to actually using with a leash, my dog simply would not have it. He would struggle and/or flop to the floor and not move, and he always found a way out of the nose piece, even though it fit the way the video said it should. My dog is very stubborn and the most I could ever get him to walk on this was one lap around the living room. I wish this had worked for us, but it just wasn't a good fit for us. We bought the ""Easy Walk Dog Harness"" by the same brand at the same time, thinking we'd start with this one and work our way up to just the regular harness. It didn't work out that way, but the easy walk hardness was a much better fit. Don't give up too quickly if you have a difficult dog, or are an inexperienced dog owner like I am."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with."

Nutritional and fitness experts, Clint Evans and E. Calvin Barber 11, write an easy to read book on the steps needed to improve health and lose unsightly and dangerous pounds by simple changes in diet and exercise. Many diet and exercise books abound, but this book is exceptionally user-friendly, backed up with medical and scientific research and is easy to conform to -- resulting in stunning changes to overall health, wellness and fitness.

Clint explains which foods sabotage both your health and weight loss, explains what certain foods do to harm the body and how to make choices that will maintain good health -- not to mention creating a body that looks  . . . hot.

Clint believes that an improper diet and intake of fast food, prepared food with dangerous additives, as well as foods containing hormones, pesticides and antibiotics, may well cause many of the modern diseases plaguing our country today. As co-founders of Hip Chick Fitness, Calvin and Clint tackle both "" the devastating downtrend in health . . . and the alarming surge in the obesity trend"". When following the guidelines of "" Get Down to 150,"" people may both prevent and/or improve upon diseases like diabetes, food allergies, cancer and heart disease, just to name a few. Calvin tackles the importance of the right type of exercise by presenting a routine that is simple, short and effective for both cardio and strength building.

This book is an important asset to not only just looking good, but feeling good as well. Their solutions are ""long-term, sustainable, and affordable"". The only thing the reader has to lose by reading this book is unwanted pounds.

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!"

The bat is designed to be a little too cold, so it's not ideal for a bat like this. I wish it was a little thicker, but I don't think it's a bad idea. I'd be more inclined to buy a heavier bat. I just wish there was some kind of ""blinking"" on the bat when I got it, and if I got one I'd be happy. I'm happy with it, but I'm a little concerned about it being too soft. I'll be keeping it at my home to get a better grip on it.

He will go to the vet and the vet will say that if he chews on something, he will get a vet check. I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his first time using this. He has been on it for about a month now and has started to get better. He is a very picky eater and his food is less full of junk and he does not like to eat anything else. It is not for a chewer.

When his cousin, living out in the Alaskan Bush, invites him to visit and assist in building a cabin, Campbell can't turn down the offer. In fact, he decides to take his eldest daughter, Aidan, a young teen, along. The two make three separate and unforgettable trips, which are narrated in this story. Awe, beauty and danger everywhere, he's written it in a way that allows the reader to be right there on the trips. The only thing that could have made this story better was if we had learned first hand how his daughter viewed the trips. Wonderful adventure for the armchair traveler or Alaskan dreamer."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I still can't get over what a 'find' this film was.  I've never been to New Zealand, and the beautiful cities and seascapes alone were enough to give this film five stars!  The story line was educational.  I later did some research to better understand the Moari people.  That info would have been helpful before watching the film actually.  That added layer of obligation, and duty to his sense of origin would have made some parts of the movie easier to track.  While they did offer us some subtitles during more intimate tribal converstaions there were still words used that made no sense to a yankee like me.  The other thing I enjoy about foreign films is that they don't always tie everything up in a beautiful Tiffany box and bow.  This movie is no exception.  Life doesn't resolve itself in 2 hours.  The movie challenged it's viewers to think about life choices, desires, and the realtiies of following your heart."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I'm a big fan of Ms. Baeli. I've read all the AKA books and this was my least favorite. ***spoilers***. I particularly found the introduction of the Goth twins a bit unnecessary, but I can see they were necessary to help tie up some loose ends. The abrupt move to Eureka Springs felt just that, abrupt. While Phoebe is the source of all things bountiful, her purchase of the new house and the ease at which the gang made their move seemed forced. Sure, they had to get the heck out of Dodge, but establishing roots somewhere with no real investigation of the new location seemed odd. Three stars does not mean ""bad"" it just means it was an okay read. Nothing will stop me from hoping that there is a book seven as I really want to know what they make of their new home and how Phoebe will resolve her quest for meaning in her life. On a technical note, there were several typos which drive me nuts."

I tried several different calls and it was not working well but when I hung up and the music came back on nice volume.  It would have been fewer stars had I care about the call part of it.

Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"It is all plastic - pretty sure the mirror is to.
Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.
For street only bike use with noted size issue. Not sure how much you'd really actually use it off road anyways.

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Nice unit, although shipped with old firmware that supposedly has problems under 10.3.9. Since the drive has no direct contact with the case, and there is no fan, I would be reluctant to use it for a hot running drive. The attachment did not seem very well designed, and I could see the drive breaking loose. But these same weaknesses are also a strength; firmware can be upgraded, no fan means silent, and the rubber hard drive attachments insulate against noise. I was pleased with the value.

Failed on me, looked like corrupted firmware that could not be updated."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I have a very-sound sensitive 8 year old child (as in, have had to flee any fireworks, gun shots, or anything even mildly loud since she was a baby).  Having a set of earplugs (that can be put in by her unobtrusively) and a set of ear muffs (when she is too scared to be self conscious) is a sanity saver for all of us.

The small version fits her and her older sister perfectly, and is slightly small for my normal head sized-husband (way to small for giant-headed me).  But with an open floor plan, I think I am going to get some bigger versions to have around the house.  I realized they could be invaluable if the girls ever start humming tunes from Frozen when we are trying to read.

PROS:

Very comfortable (size small works for my kids, get larger for adults)
They (semi) collapse to a somewhat smaller size (though do not fold down completely)
Solid (I can thrown them into a backpack without worrying about them)

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"**UPDATED AT THE END**

When we got our new dog, my wife and I decided that we were only going to go with good products that didn't contain any harsh chemicals! After searching around a little, we decided on Cain & Able because I love the smell of Peppermint and Tea Trea is a wondrous plant!

GENERAL
First off, this shampoo smells great out of the bottle! It's not too strong after our puppy is dry, but it really does leave a very nice smell on her. I can't say that the pump is as bad as some people have mentioned, but then again we only have a 21lb dog so we don't have to use all that much on her!

EFFECTIVENESS
We have noticed less itching from our dog, something that has nothing to do with fleas, but according to our vet probably something to do with her diet before we got her (she was a street rescue). She doesn't seem to desire to lick it once she has been washed, but even if she did we feel a lot better knowing that there are no artificial perfumes and chemicals that might be bad for her! We can't comment on the effectiveness of being an insect repellent, but both of the main ingredients are known to be natural repellents and we feel safe knowing she is protected!

WHY 5 STARS??
- Great value for a safe and earth-friendly product
- Smells GREAT!
- Contains no harmful chemicals!

OVERALL
Overall we are very happy with this purchase, and our puppy seems to love it! I highly recommend this product, especially if you care about what seeps into your dog's skin!

**UPDATE 03/2012**
We have been using this shampoo exclusively for over 5 months now, and we are still VERY happy with it! Our dog doesn't itch at all any more and her coat is shiny (a good diet greatly helps this)! We will continue buying this product unless we happen upon anything better!"

They provided protection for my feet while walking on hot parking lot, hot sand, and uneven terrain.  They did not work well for climbing Dunn's River Falls.  The rushing water gets into the shoe and pulls it off the foot.  The band across the instep isn't sufficient to keep the shoe on when you've got a lot of water force.  I'd say to size down if you're between sizes.  In summary:  great for the beach and the walk to the beach but pick something else for climbing falls or other more active use."

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"READ THIS BOOK!!!

I recieved this book as a gift from a friend. He was required to read this book for a college economics class. I absolutly fell in love with this book. I do not read much, so an 1100 page book is a big undertaking for me. I will pass on what my friend told me:  The first 200 pages will seem slow because of the character discriptions and history. Give it those 200 pages and you will be hooked and it will read a lot faster. It is amazing that one person could compile everything that is in this book. What a work of art. As a reader, you will definetly start looking at the issues surrounding you in a different light. Only negative:  ""The Speach"" at the end of the book. It's way too long winded and over the head.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Savannah Martin has not had an easy time of it. At fourteen, her mother abandoned her and, despite being fostered as part of a caring family, the scars still run deep. Returning home after breaking away from an abusive relationship, the heartache is not over. The patriarch of the family has been murdered and the family is reeling from the loss and the continuing threat to their business and their lives. Jared Corbit is her sister Lexis boyfriend and she wished she felt brotherly thoughts towards to him. What was she going to do?

Told from Savannahs point of view, her emotional turmoil feels so real. There seems to be one punch after another to herself and those around her and the anguish and she feels cannot be hidden. The author knows just the right thing to say to convey the mood, the feelings of uncertainty, pain and love. And there is a lot of love in this story despite tackling the serious issues. Abuse and its ripple effect, abandonment and its life-long consequences are at the center of Savannahs struggle as she tries to deal with her family and the situation she finds herself in now. Jared is more than she feels she deserves and the roller coaster of events that happen don't ease that feeling. Surprising twists and still a lot of uncertainty has me eagerly looking for the second part of this two-book storyline."

This game is at heart a three player game."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Nalini Singh certainly writes these books at a good pace. This is the fifth in the series, following 'Slave to Sensation' (September 2006), 'Visions Of Heat' (March 2007), 'Caressed By Ice' (September 07) and 'Mine To Possess' (February 2008), so she's managing to churn out two per year. I suppose this is on a par with many other authors but, having finished 'Hostage to Pleasure', I wonder if this author with her original ideas is perhaps a slight victim of her success.

'Hostage to Pleasure' was a good read. We had a varied cast of characters as always (shapeshifters including leopards, wolves and even rats), the Psy (Mr Spock-like beings who communicate telepathically) and occasional references to humans. We have characters who have their own bad memories, demons, difficulties, fears and a central love story which shows two people growing together and learning to gain strength from each other. Unfortunately for this reader at least the story felt a bit tired. Somehow I never quite felt I connected with Dorian Christensen, latent leopard shapeshifter and member of Lucas's pack, or with Ashaya Aleine, Psy scientist whose conditioning is not only fracturing but who may have never been properly conditioned anyway. It doesn't seem like a great deal actually happens in this story and for those who haven't read the previous books the cast of characters is fairly large and might get confusing. I was less than convinced by Ashaya's sister Amara and the ways in which the two interacted (and I also found the similarity of the names confusing at times).

Nalini Singh's worldbuilding continues in this novel with more about the council and another group, Pure Psy, which didn't always feel particularly connected to this story. I like the author's Psy/Changeling world but I found this book rather forgettable and nowhere near as good as 'Caressed by Ice'. It's a good read, worth the four stars, but not as good as some of the others."

I also know that in the East there is a history of suicidal protests like 1) Buddhist monk burned himself to death in 1960's Vietnam, 2) girls burning themselves protesting their husbands in Afghanistan, 3) Japanese jumping off cliffs with babies in arms because they feared the Americans at end of WWII, 4) Japanese samurai's hary cary, 5) 17 suicides in Chinese factory in 2 years because of poor working conditions.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"I picked this machine up at a garage sale for 10 bucks. It was used once and still in its original box with everything it came with. I figured it was worth a try. I roasted a 5.4-lb chicken and took note of the useful tips I saw throughout the reviews here. Spray the back plate and prongs with cooking spray, line the drip tray with foil, tie the legs and wings to hold together tightly, put it on the rack with the legs facing away from the motor. In 80 minutes it was done without any problems. It was the juiciest chicken we've ever had, very tasty indeed. You cannot get this from your oven, no way. The complaint of some about the heat this puts out wasn't a problem. I have a ceramic cooktop and it was just fine on it. I can't wait to try turkey breast or a very small turkey.
I took one star away for the following: the rotators sometimes have a skip or delay because one wheel sits on the other without any additional latch to keep them together. For chicken roasting this is less of a problem, but I can see lighter foods or unbalanced loads have an issue. There is no on or off button, instead you have to unplug to turn it off and there is no pause button to stop the rotisserie to check for doneness, you have to unplug to stop it. Was it worth $10? Heck yes, would I pay the regular price? Probably not."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Good story with nonstop action . There were a lot of characters and changes in scene and perspective, which at times caused a little confusion. Lamb created some interesting characters, and since this was the debut and introduction , it will be interesting to see where she goes with them . I found it interesting that meticulous research and experience ( Lamb's biography states that she had a career as a therapist) were mixed with some episodes where we were kind of forced to suspend disbelief and just go along for the ride . That's one of the reasons why as I write this review I don't know exactly how to classify it. It is kind of a cozy , a little bit of a procedural and also a work of creative license.

The third book, The Last Hero, is a very well written book. It is a very well written book with a strong plot and characters that will keep you interested.

Well today that all changed, and my daughter had a massive blow out at her swim class.  Not the easy to clean type of blow out either, liquidy, messy and disgusting (and utterly mortifying).  That being said, this diaper contained it.  I don't even know HOW it contained it.  My daughter's teacher literally lifted her out of the pool to give her to me to decontaminate her and she said, ""wow - this is a good swim diaper""."

Also coming to the community is Anna-Grace, a cousin of Alexas, who is planning on marrying Steven.  Secrets, both from the past and in the present, abound among the novels characters.

They're also capable of grabbing huge things, which can be really useful. They are definitely more expensive than other similar pliers, but they're also better made. I use them while working on cars all the time. The teeth on these pliers make them ideal for grabbing radiator hoses and coaxing them off barb fittings. Breaking old, stubborn hoses off radiators can be a huge pain and these pliers make that job much much easier.

This product wasn't even worth the $30 I spent including shipping and the overall price is $99... It's plastic. Cheap plastic. Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I recently purchased the ""ultra"" model on Amazon along with the forever litter tray and crystals.  I haven't used the Forever litter tray yet (the Scoopfree Ultra came with one tray/crystals so I'm using that first.)  The scoopfree ultra machine seems very sturdy and I'm very satisfied with my purchase so far.  I really like the counter that keeps track of how many times the machine is used, at first I thought it was an unnecessary feature, but it really helps to know the cats are actually using it and when to replace the cartridge.  I have two cats and at first they saw the machine and were scared of it.  I mixed in some of their old litter and took away the old litter box completely and I'm happy to report they are both using it!  I'm keeping the hood off for now, I'm concerned that they feel too intimidated if they are enclosed inside the box, I will put it back on in the future when they are more comfortable with the new machine.  When my item was delivered, it was not sent in a shipping box with padding, only in the manufacture's box with a label slapped on.  Needless to say the box was beaten and looked taped together when it arrived.  In hindsight, I probably would recommend buying the box at a local pet store instead of online, luckily I've never had to return anything to amazon, but it seems like it would be a big hassle if the unit arrived broken or the cats decided not to use it.

Box works just as I had expected, no complaints (although it is kind of loud, but what do you expect?!)  I'm very satisfied with this product."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"Why, oh why, do I keep on reading these! I have to chalk it up to sentiment, and perhaps the slim hope that a new ghostwriter will revive this once-charming series.

Simply put, this is a mess. There is the usual check-in with the mob of Pickax residents from earlier books, most of whom make brief and baffling appearances with little or no relation to the plot. The residents of this decidedly odd town - 400 miles north of reality - show up in droves for bookstore openings, stultifyingly dull lectures and amateur theatricals. (Thank god they seem to have given up eating pasties at every opportunity.)

The cats are little more than furniture these days, with Yum Yum barely making an appearance. Polly now manages a bookstore, but remains her snobby, charmless self. Qwill seems to have become the town errand boy, and, of course, pounds his mustache to a fare-thee-well.

The plot? It almost looked as though there would be one this time. But the reader is drawn in, only to be cruelly disappointed by an ending that lacks, well... an ending.

It is very philosophical for those who haven't read the articles.  It is also gory and dark and shows some things that some people probably don't want or need to see, so not for everyone.  I also liked that the storyline ends at the end of the season; it is what it is with no chance for decline, sell-out, revisionism, inconsistency, et cetera.

Second, the title in French is more descriptive ""men who hate women"". Very strong; a male friend of mine asked ""is that possible?"" and after reading the book you see why they chose such a strong title.

It advertised a series, but a series is a group of books that have related characters and/or storylines.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I've been waiting (mostly patiently) for the third book in the Weston Family series.  I loved the first one so much and was sad to hear the publisher dropped the series.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I have been an organic apple cider vinegar user for a couple decades now. What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"Gina McKay has an entirely different set of skills than most people realize.

The first book in the series follows the story of a woman and her dog, who are both in love with each other.  It takes place in a small town.  This is a very short story, but it is a very good one.  I can't wait to see what happens next.

This book is about a young woman who is on a mission with a group of people to help her to find her way back to her family.  She is forced to leave her small town to become a veterinarian and her dog is a complete failure.  Her dog is one of the best I've ever seen and she is a wonderful person.  She has a lot of issues to deal with and she has to find herself.  I really liked this book.  It was well written and had a very well written plot.  I will definitely be looking for more by this author.  This is a great"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I listened to this audio book this week & found it to be very enjoyable.  The history of ""The Pythons"" is given in the voices of those who lived it (although at times, the audio quality leaves much to be desired).  How else would one want to learn the history of something?  If you are interested in the beginnings, middles, and ends of Monty Python's existence, this may be the book for you!"
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,I've had this in my car for 3 years now and I still love it. I have one in my car and the other in a garage. The sound is crystal clear and it's nice to have a little extra in the trunk. The size is perfect and the volume level is not loud enough to drown out my music. I also love the fact that it has a telescoping lens. I just can't imagine not having a camera on it. I like that it has a remote control for voice commands. It's not bulky but I really like that it has a built-in camera. I've found that it is really easy to operate it and not have to worry about it falling off the dashboard. I love that it has a USB charging port for my phone and tablet. It's a neat little gadget that I can keep in the trunk for long

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"We've had this two years now.  We use it sporadically, so perhaps 80-100 oranges in those two years.  It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.  One reviewer complained about batteries....unit plugs in, no batteries, so at least 1 false negative review.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I would like to begin by making it very clear that women are not the only ones who are subject to betrayal from their significant other. Although it may be harder for a male to admit, we also can be hurt and severely wounded emotionally by our spouse. With that being said, I was a little cautious about purchasing this book only because it is written by a female and I feared it would only be targeted to the female perspective.

Boy, was I wrong! This book was written for females and males equally. As a man reading this book I never felt like the author wasn't talking specifically to ME. Since the author went through these experiences herself, you can tell that she wrote from the heart and can empathize with everyone of her readers. It's almost as if I am listening to a close friend or family member offering me heartfelt as well as straight to the point, detailed instructions on how to overcome, move on with your relationship, and heal. I will definitely be recommending this book to any family and friends who share a similar experience."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I have say I was a little disappointed with the quality of the product, but I am pretty confident that it will last a long time.  The ring itself is pretty sturdy, and the color is pretty striking.  The size is a little small for me, but it's not a problem.  I have a large chest, which is a little on the small side, but it fits my heart better than I would like.  The color scheme is a little more subdued, but it is still pretty good.  The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.  I really don't care that much about the color, so I guess I will just buy the colors.This is the only one I have that will fit my Glock 22 perfectly.  The only negative is that it's a little too large.  If you're going to carry this, you'll need to get a larger size.  It's a little bulky for my Glock 22.

I have noticed that my cat does not cover his feces with the pellets very well though, and I must clean up immediately after he goes. I am not sure if this is due to the product or not, because he covered them better with pine shavings and gravel used before. Perhaps he doesn't like the feel of the pellets in his toes?

I wanted something that would be easier to carry around with me, and I wanted a way to quickly get home when I'm not in the car or doing my homework. This is the perfect solution for me.

I love this camera. I don't have a lot of trouble with it, but I've had some issues with it. I've been using the camera for a couple days now, and it's been great.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I've been waiting for these boots all my life.  I have had severe lower back problems for a couple of decades.  I can do pretty much everything, including walking, without too much discomfort, but standing for any period more than a couple of minutes is incredibly painful.  Last weekend I spent 6 hours on my feet in these boots while canning and I never got sore at all.  Without sounding hyperbolic, these boots are kind of life-changing for me.  No other ""comfort"" shoe or boot has ever made one bit of difference in how I can function; these boots allow me to do everything I never wanted to do before: shop; socialize on my feet; work, etc.
As for the fit, I sized down as I have with my other FitFlops and there's still a little bit of extra room.  I don't mind this because I live in a place where thick socks make sense.  They fit well with a pair of thick socks, or two pairs of regular weight socks.
As for how they look, when I first put them on I thought they looked a bit like moon boots or Earth Shoes.  I was ambivalent about wearing them for the first couple of days and just kept trying them on in front of the mirror until I got used to them.  Now I LOVE the way they look and have gotten many compliments on how cute and stylish they are.  The look is a bit of a departure for me, as I'm used to wearing a bigger, more masculine boot, like a biker boot or a Doc Marten.  But these are adorable.  I love the extra height they give me.  I love that I can tuck my pants in or wear them over.  I've pretty much worn them every day for the last couple of weeks.  I'm already looking at getting a suede pair.
Buy these boots.  They're everything."

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Maisie Dobbs just kept popping up on Amazon lists for months, so I though I'd try it. I was not as impressed as I had expected.  Maisie is able to slave all day as a maid and  read Kant at night.  i find it nearly impossible to believe.  Also, she combines a love of philosophy with psychology, but all her psychology seems not to have any of the sexist and other prejudices which were rampant at the time.  She has powerful friends.  In this book, everyone she meets becomes her friend, which is why it reminds people of Nancy Drew.  There's a lot of interesting history in the book, and its style and pacing are good.  Winspear is trying to make her Maisie a girl who can meet anyone, but that is the least credible part of the book.  Snobbery in England was a national obsession that took a hard blow with the Great War, but didn't die without a lot of other assalults.  At least Winspear references it, but these difficulties are too easily overcome by Maisie and her always right attitude and approach.  Some of the tips on how to make people talk seem odd to me.  Manipulative or new agey or just stuck in to explain why the most stiff  upper lip people would share their family secrets with Maisie.  I will probably read on or two more in the series, because this book had to introduce Maisie nd give her an adventure/mystery/plot to start off the series.  If I have to read about an anachonistic girl superdetective, I'm content with the Mary Russell series by Laurie King.  if i want post WWI mysteries, there is Charles Todd's amazing series.  And if you want old school writing by a woman who was contemporary with the whole WWI era, Dorothy Sayers Lord Peter Wimsey series are usuaaly in print."

If you're a Miranda fan, you'll enjoy this FOX TECHNICOLOR MUSICAL. Michael O'SHEA looks a little too old and his uniform is a few sizes too small...to bad they didn't cast PERRY COMO in this leading role. Also O'SHEA is not the best singer either...most all other cast members do a great job...EXCEPT...PHIL SILVERS who is loud and ANNOYING!
Carmen has two colorful production numbers, the first, typical Miranda, the second and last is Carmen in a totally different appearance THAN WE HAVE SEEN IN THE PAST, a different 'short'costume than usual showing more leg...the lighting in this number is somewhat over the top...however, looks great in this pristine transfer. Only problem I had is in the EXTRA FEATURES: The ""STILL GALLERY"" feature in my copy doesn't allow my access to it...used two different DVD players and both had the same problem. The Film, Scenes, Trailer, and the SUPERB DOCUMENTARY are no problem. The documentary is in four parts...great interviews, vintage still photos and live performances, both candids and her FOX production numbers make this one of the best Documentaries out there...the Documentary is worth the price of this DVD ALONE! I give it 5 STARS...the 'still' problem may be in MY COPY ONLY...(don't let this deter you from puchasing this film). A MUST HAVE for the CARMEN MIRANDA FAN! THANK YOU FOX!!!"

We added this to our collection and thought it would be a nice addition to the other one. I had to get a replacement and then the game was stopped. This is a game that is fun to play and a good size for the price. If you have a child that likes to play with the game, then this is a great game to play with. Overall, I would not buy this game for any reason. It's very simple to play and very easy to learn. The game will last a while and you will not feel like a loser."

I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to expand in a small space or take it for travel.  The price was reasonable too given the quality of the product."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,CG,"Initial inspection out of the box. The only problem is that it comes with a small screw driver. I had to replace the driver with a different one, so it is not that big of a deal. If you are thinking about buying one of these you should definitely buy the Makita DeWalt 11-Inch 24-Inch 24-Inch Makita DeWalt, with the 9-Inch Makita DeWalt, and the 12-Inch Makita DeWalt, because the DeWalt is the best. I'm glad I did. I like the design of this blade. I have to get the blade to come out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck with a box full of knives. This blade is the best I have used. I would recommend this blade to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright. I use them to light up a room and they are very good. I have been using them for several months now and I am very happy with them. I have used the adjustable dimmer switches in the kitchen to dim the lights in the kitchen. I have had this for about a year now and am very happy with it. The dimmer switch is very dim and I have not had any problems with it. It does not come with a timer, so if you have a timer in your kitchen, you can set it to turn off the lights but you can not turn off the dimmer switch."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light."

The Thunderchews have worked great on him.  Within minutes it calms him down.  I didn't think it would work that well but am so happy that it does.  Our dog was pitiful during thunder episodes.  I am not sure if it works the same on all dogs but I can testify that for my dog it is a miracle and has a great calming effect.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"""Don't be a-feared.""  Even though it's an interesting subject matter, it's not a documentary.  It's not a film for the younger generation, or for those who are in the middle of a career in the movie business.  If you are a teenager, you probably don't know what a documentary is or what the genre is.  There's a lot of nudity, sex, and violence in the movie, and there's an interesting story line that moves along very slowly.  The director is very young, and he has a lot of time on his hands.  This movie is a movie that is a work of art, and it's not for the children.  The reason I like this movie is because it has a lot of nudity and sex in it, and it's a very interesting subject matter.  I really liked the ending of the movie, and I think that was the best ending I have seen in a long time.  It was a really moving movie, and I think that the director's heart was very clear.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I wasn't sure if I was going to like this or not - a mix of Tudor history and fantasy/magic? I was pleased to find that it was excellent, and I read it in two days!

The author clearly knows her subjects very well indeed, which always makes such a difference. The history itself is detailed and accurate, and I very much liked the accounts of the day to day domestic life of the period. I'm fascinated by the thought of possible alternative lives, and the idea of what might have happened had Henry VIII believed his wife Anne Boleyn over the accusations of her enemies is an intriguing one. Of course all events have a butterfly's wing effect, and Ms Taylor imagined the fates of other members of the Tudor court very cleverly. The politics of the day are very well described, too; how quickly, in those dangerous and turbulent times, one could fall from favour...

I am not usually one for magic/fantasy novels, but this element of the story was most convincing; it made me think of a more grown up and serious Hogwarts! I wonder how much of it was just the author's imagination and how much was taken from the beliefs and practices of the time; I imagine it's a combination of the two. I particularly liked the parts about numerology and the breaking of codes; oddly enough I was only watching a TV programme last night about the use of codes in secret communications during Elizabethan times, and Ms Taylor has all this spot on. To sum up, the fusing of history with fantasy is very successful, and I shall definitely be reading the next book in the series before too long. I think it would appeal to anyone interested in the Tudor period, and to those who enjoy reading believable fantasy."

watching it lay there and breathe like a real sleeping puppy. She would just stand and watch it for hours. Over the years, she
has loved this little puppy named, ""Honey"". During all her visits over the years, it was one of her favorites. It finally stopped working,
and we could not fix it. My Grand-daughter said if I ever found another one, she would really love to have it for her own.
I found it here on Amazon. The exact one that she wanted.
I just gave this Puppy to her on her 10th birthday, and she is thrilled. She lost her real dog, so this sleeps on her bed with her
at night. It came in it's own adorable Puppy bed, with a brush, a tagged collar, and real adoption papers to fill out. She is thrilled.
It is very well made and very real looking. I would say any child over 3 or 4 would love to have this Huggable Breathing Puppy to sleep on their bed with them at night. This made one little girl very happy."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"LOVE THIS COVER!! The quality is excellent and I love that it covers not only the back seat, but also the sides of the back seat, the floor, and the backs of the front seats. Before I got this cover, I had old blankets trying to protect my leather seats from 2 large labs!  And any other covers I purchased didn't fit well and ended up useless.  It has great coverage, awesome high-quality material, and is easy to install. Can be done in 5 minutes, or even less if you are in a rush and you skip some of the steps that fully secure it. There are many straps, buckles, ties, and fittings that attach it around headrests (rear seats and the front seats), tie around the seat belts, and fabric fittings that are meant to slip in the back of the seat and the sides of the vehicle as well as between the bottom of the seat and the back of the seat so that it does not slide around too much. It fits well in my Lexus ES350.  This does the trick of protecting the leather from their nails.  I especially like the generous flap that connects to the front seats and then hangs down to the floor to keep their hair contained, instead of flying all over.  I ordered the grey even thought my interior is tan.  I couldn't tell if I would like the tan shown in the pictures and I also have grey in other areas of my car so it blends well.  It was very easy to install but haven't figured out how to get the back of it to stay in place better but I feel like there is a way with a little help from my husband.  The main function is to keep the seat protected from their nails since I have the perforated leather that can easily be torn. I would definitely recommend!  I received this product at a discount for my honest opinion."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This is the first smart watch I've used, but I have been interested in trying one for a while now.  After using one I have mixed opinions on how useful it really is.

The first thing that struck me is that this thing is huge!  I've seen people wearing Apple watches, this is several times bigger and bulkier.  It came with a completely drained battery, which you have to partially charge to set it up.  The partial charge took 20-30 minutes.  My opinion is mixed on the charger.  It's handy not to have to plug a wire into the watch, as it's magnetic.  On the down side the watch has to be laid out flat to charge, so it takes up quite a bit of room.

Installing Android wear on my phone was easy enough.  The Michael Kors site did not work on my phone, but did work on my tablet.  I downloaded a few applications from Android to change the watch face, and check the weather.  It was fun to play with the different faces, there are a wide variety available for free.  The weather apps are also very useful.

The notifications are pretty cool, but are one of the reasons I question the usefulness.  So little text fits on the screen that I ended up going to my phone to read everything.  Similarly, setting up Google maps on the phone and then navigating from the watch is really only useful if walking, and I'd still rather see a larger map on my phone.  The Google translate is kind of cool, I've tried that out a couple of times converting to Russian and it works pretty well.

All in all I think this is kind of a niche product.  The size limits the market even more, as it's huge."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Desperately needs a backlight so you don't need a flashlight to read it when used in a dark corner. The user interface is clumsy but can be figured out.

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"In his later years, Welles often complained that he spent more time trying to find money to make films than he did actually making films. And seeing Welles still scrambling for cash in his last days as a commercial pitchman for such products as Dark Tower and Paul Masson Wines (""Where we will sell no wine before it's time""), you know he was right.
This entertaining and exhaustive book by Simon Callow doesn't deal with most of his film career - only covering up to 1941. (We're still waiting on part two to cover the rest. Simon? Simon?). However, what it does do is clear up much of Welles' confusing past (he often told conflicting stories in interviews) and delve into the two main works that set Welles up for stardom...and the fall...in Hollywood - The War of the Worlds radio broadcast and Citizen Kane. And no wonder they were sharpening knives for the boy wonder when Welles publicly put down the Hollywood community, his Kane script bit the hand that feeds him by taking obvious shots at newspaper mogul Randolph Hearst and he was given the kind of directorial freedom veteran directors could only dream of.
Some people may tire of reading about Welles' theatre days with Houseman, anxiously waiting to get to the meat of his film career. But to understand why Welles became a ""has-been"" at 26 and the long slide to come, this is required reading."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I ended up sending it back.  I saw several reviews for this knife that gave it rave reviews, but I just didn't care for the wave design.  If you don't want it to open with the wave, it was difficult to pull the knife out without the wave snagging something.  Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.  I guess you would learn to deal with it if you need a knife to deploy that quickly.  I ended up buying the Delica 4 with the saber grind, and I LOVE it.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Archangel Zach is a quick paranormal read that I found to be interesting and enjoyable.  The plot is solid and the writing is strong and descriptive.  The author has created an engaging world where there are human angels on earth with special powers as well as the Archangels from the Angelic Realm.  These are not supposed to mix in a relationship, but you know what happens when something's forbidden...

Zach's character is tormented and has never gotten past losing his love over three hundred years ago.  It is easy to empathize with him, and to understand why he keeps Shasa at arms length.  I did have a difficult time seeing the two of them together, for some reason they just did not click for me...I just didn't feel that spark between them, I'm not sure exactly why.

The story itself moves well, the second half quicker than the first mostly due to the action and drama that is occurring at that point.  I was able to read this in less than a day, and found the story easy to follow even though I haven't read anything else from this series yet.

If you're a fan of angel books, especially when they mix with humans, this is a good story for you.  Recommended for 18+ due to some language and adult sexual scenes."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Well, this one was very short. To the point I was in no way ready for it to end. I just wanted it to keep going, to see what happened to Emily & Michael, because dayam is the reader left hanging at the end.

If this novella (or short, I guess) is a ploy to get readers to need to read on in the series, then congratulations, because the author has succeeded. This is definitely a great introduction to some of the character's in Kemmerer's Elemental world. I liked the two main character's a LOT. The writing has an easy simplicity to it that helps with the cadence of reading. It's full of conflict-romance, too, but without being overly mushy, which can sometimes happen in YA.

Though I'm left with quite a lot of questions: how their `powers' work because that isn't fully explained; the why and wherefore of it all isn't in here; I'm left unsure whether or not regular humans exist around these `special' folk, or of the hierarchical structure of it all and why certain families are expected to obey the requests of others/or stick to agreements made with them; there is evidently some kind of societal ladder and which rungs people belong on is obviously an important part of the world created here ...

To expand the praise, what I found especially noteworthy was how skillfully Johnson weaved real history into a very satisfying historical, complete with a bit of romance. I also have to mention how beautifully Johnson used language. The Publishers Weekly review says Johnson is ""no Shakespeare,"" but to say this misses the point that she did use language quite wonderfully. It seemed completely authentic to the time period. Her imagery was lovely. She used details that convinced you that you were in a real place at a real time. The Gentleman Poet was a stunning work and I highly recommend it!"

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"These are fantastic! They fit perfect on my Glock 17. I also love that they have a full sized inner barrel.  The front sight is also very light and easy to adjust.  The only thing I would change is the size of the scope.  This is a great optic for the money.  I have a 11"" scope on the Springfield XD scope with a telescopic sight.  I would buy these again.  I am very happy with these sights.I love these socks! They are comfortable and easy to wear. I use them everyday for cycling, camping, hiking, and hiking. I am a big fan of these socks. I wear them daily to keep warm, and I like that they keep me from sweating. They also keep my feet warm and dry. I do recommend these socks to anyone. My only complaint is that I have a large head. I am 6'2"" and the size 6 fit my head. I would recommend these socks for anyone.I love this bike seat. It's small and easy to use. I have it mounted on my front end, and it's very comfortable to ride. The seat itself is a bit on the stiff side, but it's not a problem. It's also easy to install and adjust. The seat is a little big for me, but it's a lot of room for storage. I ride a Honda Civic with a seatpost for my bike, and it's a little too large for my bike. It's not a big deal, but I'm not a big fan of the seatpost at all. I think I would have preferred to"
Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Barry Raspbody has a unique sense of humor.  Most of the jokes were a bit of a stretch.  There were a few good, although painful, puns.  He also had a few that makes one want to smack either their forehead or his.  They might be easier to understand  and appreciate if they were presented in a comedy routine."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I now have four out of the five colors these pants come in, and I'll buy the fifth (white) during the next sale.  Just great pants.  I have a dozen and a half linen garments - shirts, T's, pants, shorts - and these are my favorites.  Great material, great cut, and I even like this color.  I'd read a contrary review on the darker of the tan shades, but this is nicer than the lighter of the two browns.  I wish they came in even more colors; I'd buy them."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My big dog just goes crazy over this toy.  She will even flip it around and play all by herself, but mostly it is a retrieving toy.  There are 2 balls encased in the heavy nylon fabric, one is hollow and produces a squeaker noise that is loud and sounds like 3 different tones at once.  I really like this toy because it stands up to very hard tug games.  My dog isn't a chewer but I still pick it up and put it away after playtime just in case."
Books_5,1.0,OR,"Honestly, I was very disappointed with this book. I thought since I absolutely loved 'the lovely bones' that this would be another amazing read but I was wrong. The story line had the potential to be a good book but it really just fell flat. It was an extremely slow and excruciating read and the flash backs were not seperated well from the here-and-now in the story. The characters left no lasting impact and overall the book was one that would not leave a trace of recognition in my mind. In a few years I may see the spine of this book on the very bottom of my bookshelf and I will have forgotten I've even read it. That's how much of an impact it left on me."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Bed frames hold up a mattress, and usually, that is all they do.  This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"These are good shorts for work. They are comfortable and stylish, but they are knee length and made of a standard materials for slacks which makes them professional looking enough for a casual office setting. I wish they would make their slacks, Capri pants, and shorts in a size 2 more often. Most of their styles only come as small as a 4, but the slim fit styles work alright in a size 4 for those who would normally wear a 2."

Definitely a place in every woodsman or fisherman's kit."

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,CG,"I wasn't sure what I was going to say, but I did. The first couple of pages are full of action, intrigue, and then the beginning of a great romance. The story picks up right where the first book left off. I love how the author gives us the first couple of pages and then the last page, which is where the story ends. It really shows how much I love the author's writing style and how she keeps the story moving along."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"This is a solid piece of gear. I ordered it after seeing one at a friends house. 5 years old, and the handle shows no wobble. No warping, despite repeated misuse (kids). Then there's the lifetime warrantee. All in all, a sweet deal, a lifetime purchase."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking for something simple and not too expensive.  These fit the bill just fine. They are light but not too flimsy, just right for fresh out of the shower. I really like scuffs because they are so easy to walk in and out of at the bedside, and maybe out to the mailbox. I wouldn't mow the lawn in them, but hey, they are great for around the house."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"I bought two of these and both work great.  I will keep them in the house and use them when we go to bed.  The first one was a little too big for my cat and it didn't fit.  The second one was too big for my dog and it was too small.  I have to keep them in the house and use them when we go to bed.  I will keep them in the house and use them when we go to bed.  They are very easy to clean and the color is very vibrant.  I would highly recommend them.These are great, but my dog hates them.  I don't want her to chew through them, but I do have to keep a small piece of newspaper in her mouth."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,I really liked this book. I liked how the heroine was not depicted as the typical woman in Romance novels.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,CG,"Too flimsy. Especially the lunch box. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the one in the picture was the same size, but the one in the photo was a bit large. I was expecting it to be a little smaller, but it is very cute.The fabric is a little thin."
Books_5,3.0,OR,"Blasphemy is the second book featuring Wynam Ford (now a private detective). In this book, Ford infiltrates a government-run facility which has built the world's largest particle accelerator for a mere $40 billion. (Please suspend your disbelief.)  I like the way Preston has worked together several subplots which all culminate at the end of the book for a complex climax. I am also a fan of Preston's easy writing style--it's good for a quick read. I am not a fan of Preston's portrayal of Born Again Christians--I think it's a bit over-the-top, though I guess it's a reasonable depiction of a very small percentage of rapture-ready Christians. Also, Preston is clearly not a physicist, but I guess not everyone can be perfect. :) Overall, I think Blasphemy was good for a quick sci-fi/techno read, but shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's a beach-book."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"I will admit that it was an easy read, and I did not need to read the full length story. I had a lot of fun with the characters and the plot. I enjoyed that it was a little short. I will admit that I was disappointed with the shortness of the story. I liked the shortness of the story, and it was a little short. I liked the ending, but I did not like the fact that it ended a little abruptly. I would have liked to see more of the relationship between the two main characters. Overall, it was a good read and a short story. It was a good read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing. I don't think I've read a book that has a relationship between the two main characters, but I did find that I could relate to both of them. I was just not very happy with the way the book ended. It felt like the main character was trying to make her way back to her life, and the story ended abruptly. I was hoping that the author would have a more happy ending, but I didn't feel it. I felt like the book was rushed and I had a hard time getting through it. It felt like it was rushed and just a lot of time was spent on the book."
Books_5,5.0,OR,An engaging tale that parallels outcomes we might see today. Hard to put down and easy to get into. If there is any criticism it is that details were too deeply researched resulting in a few sections that continued beyond the sale. But in the end that made it all the more believable.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is my second Moen pivoting paper holder. The first model I purchased was the Moen Wembley Pivoting style. I love how easy it is to change rolls when all you need to do is pivot one end up and remove the empty roll and replace it with a new one.

This model is different than the Wembley model. On the Wembley model only the thin bar rotates up and you can easily slide the rolls on and off--but I found that the bar rattles a bit . On this model the end of the bar that pivots is attached to about an inch wide segment of  the support bracket.  The roll of paper still fits over the segment--and the extra weight on this pivoting end keeps it from rattling.

I really like these pivoting holders. I just wish I had found them sooner!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered this cape for myself for my birthday and it is amazing, I love it! I saw a similar one at Macy's that was twice the price and I am so glad I waited for this one to arrive instead, it looks even better than it does online. I ordered a large but the seller sent a medium (prob because sold out of large?) and it fits perfectly. I was a little unsure about the sizing based on the chart but I am 5'6 and 160 lbs and a medium fits me fine. The fleece is high quality and slightly stiff, it feels almost like a wool. The stiffness will help the cape keep it's shape over time. And the collar comes up slightly in the back of the next which gives it a little flair and elegance, especially when your hair is pinned up! It is very high quality and the arm holes are in exactly the right place and provide a good range of movement. The snaps on the front are very sturdy and hidden when the cape is completely closed, no buttons or zips to ruin the sleek, simple style. I can throw this on with jeans and equestrian boots for a day out running errands, or cocktail attire for an evening out...this is definitely a piece that should be added to every wardrobe."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Emilie du Chatelet was a most interesting women for her time, or for any time. A member of the French aristocracy she was adored by her father and taught unwomanly things like sword fighting, riding, languages, literature and mathematics. She also liked to dance, was a passable performer on the harpsichord, sang opera, and was an amateur actress.

As a scientist she is remembered as a footnote, if you will, to the other scientists of the day. She did research into fire, and developed theories of what is now called infra-red radiation. In the year of her death she completed the work regarded as her outstanding achievement: her translation into French, with her own commentary, of Newton's celebrated Principia Mathematica, including her derivation from its principles of mechanics the notion of conservation of energy.

She also led a life we would consider somewhat scandalous. After dutifully presenting her husband with the children expected of an arranged marriage they agreed to live apart with each taking other lovers.

I was struck with the fact that she died in 1749. Had she been born fifty years later, it is likely that she would have faced the guillotine like so many others."

She was just a little scared of the kids and didn't really like the idea of her dolls being made of wood.  The doll was very cute, but was more expensive than I expected. The dress was a bit too small for her. The back of the dress is very loose and doesn't fit well.  She has a lot of hair that will eventually get tangled up and fall out.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"This card works great and installs easily.  I am a little disappointed in the lack of software to support its functionality.

  I bought this card to be used in a Ubuntu server where I run Plex to serve my house TVs.  Installation was simple and Ubuntu/Plex worked right away without even having to install any drivers.  It just plain works.

  What I didn't like was the lack of software capabilities.  For Ubuntu there are a couple application you can get like ""Me-Tv"" or ""Kaffine"", or for me ""Plex"".  For Windows users there is less freeware to choose from, instead after buying this card you would have to go to the Hauppauge webpage and spend an additional $10 for the WinTV software.  I feel this software really should come with the card.  Also note:  In some of the screenshots and details that advertise this card it says you can watch multiple shows at the same time (showing four windows).  The only ways to watch multiple shows is with their WinTv software, no other software will let you do this (not even Plex).  Finally, if you using this for Plex note: only the primary plex account can access the program guide to watch TV, none of the other users you've created can access them."

I think the combination of the bright colors and contrasting patterns initially drew her attention. But, when I was able to move it around and make it talk, she was totally captivated. I think this could be a great first gift for new parents when they're trying to figure out how to interact with their baby. Being a puppet and playing the role of a character is very natural and more fun that doing flash cards!

Two notes: the look of this is very simliar to the Skip Hop character washcloths. My daughter (age 4) didn't make a distinction and this guy ended up in the bathtub one afternoon. Still great fun, but not used as intended. (He dried out just fine). Also, the fabric does seem to attract pet hair and lint, especially off the carpet.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Djilas was among the top leaders of the new emerging Yugoslav Republic after the Second World War. His voyages to Moscow were of extreme importance to Yugoslavian communists and for himself also. His very detailed accounts of his encounters with the leaders of Soviet Union are very interesting, but after his final visit, he begins to view things differently. I can say that I understand his point of view, but I can also  understand Moscow's attitude as well. If we are scientific enough to reject calling Soviet Union as ""imperialist"" I can move on, if not well...I do not call Soviet Union ""imperialist"" and place myself in their position. As regards to the Soviet Union the war took its toll immensely, the victory was won with awful consequences. One has  to be guarded as regards to foreign policy, one also has to think about his country and revolution primarily. When Djilas complains to Stalin about Red Army soldiers' bad behaviours, Stalin's answer shows his different perspective (to which I agree). He wants Djilas to understand that in real life things are complicated. He explains that they had to include all the men into the army, including all the convicts,so when a man fights for his life,walks for thousands of miles and sees his best friends die you can not expect him to behave as if nothing has happened. The problem with the writer is that his critics are very reasonable but when they amount to anti-communism they are not satisfactory. Djilas is convicted in Yugoslavia later for writing this book. I do not think he is an agent of imperialism but his works get attention in the West for its anti-communist views. All in all a good book worth reading but has to be supplemented with further readings on the post-war Soviet Union subject."

The fabrics are all nice and thick and everything is quilted and padded and double/triple layered fabrics. I expected something thin and sort of cheap like dress up clothes, but it is nothing like that at all. It is really nice.

The chefs hat has a nice thick comfy pink band around the head and the white part is a soft, almost silky feeling type of fabric. It lays nicely and is not stiff to fit oddly or stand up awkwardly.

The little over mit and pot holder are quilted and adorable.

The apron is put together so nicely with nice thick material and perfect hems.

The utensil set is a thick hard plastic but has no rough edges to worry about scratching any surfaces. I thought they'd be more like dollar store quality acrylic utensils, but they're not. They're cute and nice quality.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Actually, having attended a number of academic conferences myself, I am not sure this is a satire. Quite a few of the ""fictitious"" presentations in this book sported titles (and contents) that were uncomfortably familiar. (What can I say? I was young...I didn't know any better...)  As for the back-biting, infighting, petty scheming, feuds, and general unmitigated nastiness--it's all too true. Fortunately, in Lodge's hands, it's also funny enough to take the sting out of some of the more pointed barbs.

And, if Lodge's lampoon of academia isn't enough to tickle your funny bone, you'll surely get a laugh out of the misguided kidnapping, adultery, unrequited love, requited love, strippers, porn, a journey around the world, and one of the most hilarious scenes in print (a karaoke bar in Tokyo that was definitely lost in translation).

Lodge's writing is a pleasure to read. He is clever (without being precious), ironic, poignant, even lyrical in places. As befitting a novel about literary criticism, there are references to everyone we know and love: Shakespeare (All's Well That Ends Well), Oscar Wilde (The Importance of Being Ernest--the twins are found in a Gladstone bag), and, naturally, the Grail Quest with all of its incumbent post-modernist/feminist permutations. I was thoroughly delighted to see that Lodge even referenced himself. (On page 280 Angelica's father bemoans the ignorance about identical twins. He mentions that he ""didn't have the patience"" to read a novel which featured identical twins of opposite sexes. The novel was David Lodge's ""Changing Places."")

You will find this book gut-wrenchingly funny if you are in academia.  If you are not, well, just enjoy your flight."

I was left somewhat disappointed by the fact that the author didn't take the story further and wrap-up more of the storyline.

Footsteps stomped with the force of a giant on the wooden steps. Pounding in synchronization with each ragged inhale Nikki took.
Dang it. The door. Just as she lunged forward to lock it, the handle turned. She jumped back. This is probably nothing, just an innocent mix up in dates. But then again She lifted the spoon over her head.
A broad shoulder, covered in dark blue, entered her line of vision. Then a crop of longish, wavy hair. Just as the man angled his back to the door to close it
Womp! Not one to sport violent tendencies, she lowered the spoon with all the force of a pillow fight.

I had to read the book to get through the story. The author does a great job of describing the characters. I would recommend it for anyone who likes to read about relationships.I was looking forward to reading the book, but had to wait a bit for the ending. I liked the ending, but I'm not sure if it was because of the author's love for the characters or the ending. I'm sure there will be more to come.

I read this book in the middle of a work day and was disappointed. I can't imagine how much time I spent on it. I was given the opportunity to read it to my husband and I was immediately hooked. It's a good story, but I really didn't like the book. I think the ending was a little abrupt, but that's just my opinion.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I was provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I admit, that I was a little confused at first. The person who wrote the ""Single Guy"" column, was he Matthew Rhodes, or Ryan, or were they the same guy?  After I figured that out, it was pretty smooth sailing.

Ryan's column was a somewhat cynical view of Love, and the column Mia wrote, ""Lonely Girl"", was more about single women navigating the dating scene. When Ryan and Mia first met, they each had no idea they were with the person behind the column. Their focus was on the 'reality' of Love as they saw it.

They had great chemistry going until Mia figured out that Ryan was Lonely Guy and bolted. They both end up on a Bachelor type dating show as contestants. They each have their own agenda for appearing, and it is not to fall in love. Both Ryan and Mia were shocked to find out they were both going to be on the show.  I did love their back and forth teasing and wittiness in their conversations.

One not believing in love. The other feeling unlovable. There was blackmail, corruption, deceit, manipulation, love, loyalty, and family throught this book. Let's not forget a few steamy sex scenes. There is a HEA, no worries there.

This was a fun, romance read. My only regret was there was no detail on Mia's boss ever getting what was coming to her. I also wasn't 100% sure if Ryan got to write the article that he really wanted to and use some of the information against Mia's boss. I was left wanting more.

Maybe that's a good thing...."

Gabriel was great as always, he has been my number one book boyfriend since day one, and he did not disappoint.

Maybe the author felt like the story was about Gabriel and Julia and they didn't need to be answered, or maybe it was left open on purpose for a book four, I don't know, but I would have liked to know how their story ended as well.

Anyway, I am currently sitting amongst the parts of this thing trying to figure how the heck to put it together bc these are the worst instructions I've ever seen!! And I put together a much larger cat tree earlier this year.

For example, the instructions simply tell you you should have 8 lg sisal posts. What they don't decipher is that there are actually 6 of one size and two slightly smaller ones. And of the larger ones, several are weighted. It doesn't tell you which to use where. I'm going to assume the heavily weighted ones go on the bottom...

The pics in the instructions are also horrible. They are blurry and unclear. Still trying to figure out which is a base. I'm just going to look at a full color pic and wing it.

Update: I got it ""put together."" It's in quotes because I think the one piece is broken because it won't stay connected. And parts are missing from the catnip toy station. Very frustrating... There are two 'catnip stations' which are basically a hanging fuzzy ball surrounded by plastic tubes so it looks like a little cage. I am missing six of those tubes so I can't put the other catnip station on. Which means there is no stabilization there. And even the one I did add... as soon as the cats touch it, it will just pop off. Nothing really keeps it together!

And I think there need to be more longer screws. They expect you to use the shorter screws in parts where it doesn't work. I am sorry I bothered with this one. Mistake..."

I especially liked the fact that the studio version was so much more realistic and modernized, with its original look and feel.

However, when I first saw this film, I felt that I'd missed something, and I'm not sure why. I was a little disappointed by the fact that this film doesn't have a lot of great dialogue, and the actors in the film do a great job of portraying them perfectly.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Strangers With Candy is a perfect send-up of insipid topical  teen shows like My So-Called Life and the After School Specials that spewed conformist propoganda into the ears and eyes of America's youth every weekday afternoon during the 1980's.  I remember watching it back when I had cable, as well as a slew of other top-notch shows that were on Comedy Central at the time (Upright Citizens Brigade, The Daily Show, South Park, T.V. Funhouse etc...).  Strangers With Candy may not have been the best of these shows, or even the edgiest, but it very well may have been the darkest.  South Park and T.V. Funhouse were/are certainly caustic and dark, but 'Strangers' was pitch black.  This humor is truly without reverence.  Nothing is sacred, all is petty, and the mere concept of morality itself becomes the joke.

Comedy Central is truly a great network.  Whenever possible, complete creative freedom is given to (gasp!) the CREATORS of the show.  Strangers With Candy certainly benefitted from this policy; its vision is clearly uncompromised.  Every aspect of the production contributes to a consistent representation of a unified concept.

I recently rented the first and second seasons and the latter is the better of the two.  I am looking forward to renting the third season.  If you are a fan of black comedy, Strangers With Candy will tickle your funny bone - and then break it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"When I set out to buy a slow cooker for my mom, I was looking at higher models with all the bells and whistles and the convertible ones that are like 7 different kind of pots in one.  All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ... Lol."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"A longtime fan of the author, I was thrilled to see this book in the Vine program. I love Gabby's upbeat, positive, yet no-nonsense and very realistic voice. She tells it like it is, breaking down her lessons, and her life, into small meaningful chapters which pull the reader in and carry him or her through to the lesson and the meaning. This book isn't the ""pollyanna think and you'll be happy"" refrain that some authors offer. Instead, Gabby brings you into the harsh light of day, giving real life examples to the lessons, and honestly, and sometimes painfully sharing aspect of her life which a lesser person might have kept hidden.

Gabby is an inspiration to all of us spirit junkies out there, the meaning to keep trying and carry on, yet she challenges the reader to change, to look at her life in a new way, and in the end, Spirit Junkie will take the reader on a journey of introspection, transformation, and love."

This movie is based on the novelette&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/0765318741/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>
Recommended for fans of Will Smith, and science fiction (Note:  I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the story follows the book.)

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Boss Monster is a light card game for 2-4 players, that takes about 30 minutes (give or take depending on experience and number of players).

In this game, each player takes control of a boss from an 8-bit video game RPG. You must build a fiendish and deadly dungeon, and lure heroes into it with the kind of loot that they like, in order to brutally murder them. You use Room cards to build the dungeon, and Spell cards to aid you (or hinder your opponents). If your dungeon is strong enough, you will kill the heroes and collect them as ""souls"" (points). If the dungeon is too weak, the heroes will break through and wound you. Any boss who takes five wounds is killed and out of the game. But the first boss to survive and gain ten souls is the winner.

This is a solid, fast-paced card game. The theme is fantastic and I love the look of the cards. In fact, everything about the game just screams ""fun"" at first glance, right down to the parody art of famous video games and other pop culture figures. In fact, why the game succeeds is because the theme is tied so strongly to the mechanics, and they blend well, even though it's a very simple game.

It does have some faults. The rulebook could use some work and does not clarify certain basic rules. There's also something of a runaway leader problem (in our game of four, two of us were WAY ahead of the pack by an early point of the game). It's also a game that is already starved for expansions...replay value is questionable.

However, the game itself is very enjoyable for now, and I plan on playing it much more. Kudos to the Brothers for their successful Kickstarter, which amounted to a fine game."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I've worn these to my job at the sawmill (were I work outside in the cold) and so far I love them! They are not good for hiking around which I did in them the first day, but with some insoles in them, they have been very comfortable and warm! A little bigger than I expected but sometimes I wear two pair of socks so I think think I'll keep the size I have.
Waterproof so far and pretty warm! Except on wet metal (loader steps) very slip resistant. The laces are waayy too short so I had to replace them.
I had a very hard time trying to find good women's work boots with steel toe so I'm ecstatic to finally have some that had great reviews at a decent price and so far so good!

I lowered to a 3 from a 5.  The first pair were great but the second pair I bought took months to break in and caused so many blisters.  The waterproofing failed in one shoe fairly quickly so rainy days at work suck."

I read it in a day, I found it interesting and I couldn't put it down. I didn't like how it was labeled. It was a little too much information for me but I would recommend it. This is the first book I have read from this author and I am looking forward to reading the rest of her work. The characters were good and the story was very well written. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good, fast paced read. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes to have a good storyline. I was gifted this book in exchange for an honest review. I am a fan of the author's writing and this one had me hooked. I am so glad I read it and I am looking forward to more from this author.

I ordered a size large, and it fits perfectly. I ordered a size XL and it's just a bit loose. I can't wear it with a bra underneath. I just went with the XL and it's just a bit loose. I would not wear these with a bra underneath, because the material is too thick, but I would not recommend them. These are super cute and comfortable. I have wide feet, but they run a little small. They do fit my feet perfectly and I love the ""top of my feet"" look. I also like the quality. I wish they had the ""6"" part in the heel. I wear a size 8. 5, so I'm hoping they would have fit. I like the ""fleece"" of the fabric. They seem to be well made and are comfortable. I'll wear them around the house. Love this shirt!!  It is a nice color and very flattering. The material is soft and the sleeves are long enough to keep my arms warm and dry. I love it!

I really like the Blue color on it.
Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode.
or tracking a activities.
No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it.
It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone.
Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.

Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.

Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.

sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.

Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"""Back and Back and Back Again,"" the movie's third act, which also features the first two episodes of the movie, is the most solid film in the genre, and it is especially effective with the five-star ratings.  The story is told in a rather simple and almost eerie way, with a great cast of characters and a good story.  The only problem is that the film is very short, with the first half of the film taking up most of the screen time.  The film is shot in a very small window, and the picture quality is quite poor.  There is a scene where a man is walking through the woods, and there is a scene where the sound of the woods is played to a loud and clear volume.  This is a very low-budget film, and it is likely that the story is not as good as the first film.  I don't know why the director was so reluctant to do this film.  The story is based on a true story of a man who, while in the woods with"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"TRUNK MUSIC is the fifth Harry Bosch detective novel and may be the best of the series so far. Mr. Connelly writes sharp dialogue and page-turning narrative. Beyond writing mechanics, the creation of hard-boiled detective Bosch is what makes the series so interesting. Because Harry Bosch is so interesting. Set in LA and Las Vegas, TRUNK MUSIC gets the reader involved in Hollywood slease, police corruption and mob antics on the way to solving the murder of a man left in the trunk of his car (hence ""trunk music""). I am getting a bit tired with Harry Bosch getting in trouble with his police bosses and IAD (Internal Affairs Division) and his fellow detectives suspecting him of being a rogue cop. I mean, Harry has solved many murders brilliantly and, by now, they should be trusting him more. So it seems a little unrealistic that they still come down hard on him for doing his job. Perhaps Mr. Connelly will see the logical flaw in the plot there and correct that with different plot complications and tensions in future Harry Bosch books. I don't know but maybe I'll find out in the sixth Harry Bosch story, ANGELS FLIGHT. Such nit-picking aside, TRUNK MUSIC is music to my ears."

There's Meg, his mom, who's suspicious of this polished, too thin woman introduced into the family. The brother exudes resentment towards George and slumps sullenly through the film. His wife, girlishly fawns over Madeline, and gushes about her own pregnancy while excusing her sullen husband's churlishness. The father quietly goes about his woodworking and lets the action play out. Along with this family scenario, Madeline seeks out a backwoods artist to sign for her gallery. This creates a conflict when a crisis in the pregnancy draws the family together, while Madeline tends to business. The film is marred by too many scenes with low lighting make the viewer guess what's going on with whom. Additionally many scenes are muttered through and possibly key information gets missed. At first I thought Madeline was the focus of the film, but the other daughter-in-law captures the attention through the majority of the film.

The group is led by a woman named Danielle (Amy Adams) who is a former prostitute. She is a little disturbed by the murder of her ex-boyfriend who has been accused of killing her. Danielle is a bit paranoid and has a very low opinion of the police. She also has a very high opinion of the police as they are on a high level.

The story is pretty straight forward, but the acting is quite good. There is also a little bit of nudity in this film, but it is definitely not sexual. The storyline is not as dramatic as the previous films, but"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,CG,I purchased this bike online and it arrived on time. I will update this review if I find a difference. I had a friend who was very happy with her bike. She was skeptical that it was a bicycle. She says it is very sturdy. This one is a little bit larger than she thought. She says it is heavier than she thought. So it is a little heavier than she expected. It does not have a lot of grip on it. It is well made and does not come with a disc brake. The only thing I would change is that it has a small vent on it to allow it to sit upright. It is a little thicker than I thought. I am not sure why it is thinner. I would prefer it to be thicker. It is not as comfortable as I thought it would be. It is very small and I think it would be very uncomfortable for someone. I would not recommend this bike to anyone.

There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration."

Mental illness is a terrible and sad fact of life, and the ripple effects on the people around someone who suffers from a mental illness can be devastating in the extreme.  Not everyone is lucky enough to have someone who cares enough to try to make a difference, but Annabelle is fortunate to have a group surrounding her that love her and will do whatever needs to be done, physically, mentally and emotionally to help her fight her demon Anorexia Nervosa.  Falling in love is not something Annabelle thought would ever happen to her, while the 'Harpy' in her head constantly reinforced her feelings of worthlessness, but Alex fought for Belle and fought alongside her to defeat her disease and together they found an enduring love tempered in fire."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"ISBN 034536161X - Back to books related to WWII and religious artifacts. As a group, these books are interesting if only for the complete effect - from Ludlum's The Gemini Contenders to The DaVinci Code to Indiana Jones, the differences and similarities in the tales are fascinating. Indy begins the book by closing out his nearly lifelong chase after the Cross of Coronado. Ready for a return to the academic life, he returns late for the school year, only to find that his father is missing. Henry Jones has his own lifelong chase nearing an end - he appears to be within sight of the Grail Cup, and there are several groups of people who will do anything to beat him to it. Nazis, Henry's assistant Elsa, and a secret Brotherhood all have their eyes on the same prize, for their own reasons. Who will reach it first isn't nearly as important as who will be allowed to claim it. As adventure books on the subject go, The Last Crusade is an odd mix of lightheartedness and murder, which detracts from the excitement of the story in the book but played well in the movie. Overall, though, it's a nice adaptation of the screenplay by Jeffrey Boam."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I recognize that the main reason most people buy this is for sun protection. I purchased it hoping it would keep my shoulders from freezing when swimming laps outdoors when the temperature is in the fifties and sixties.  It does help some.  There is a bit more drag when swimming but the design of the short does enable you to stroke without feeling impedance.  Considered getting a heavier weight shirt but am glad I went with this lightweight model.  I used the size chart and purchased XS.  I am 5'3"", 108 pounds and 32 A (like, barely).  This fit just as I had hoped -- tight but not restricting.  No problem putting it on but a bit more challenging taking it off when wet.  All in all, a good purchase.

Although it does impart so knowledge and insight, I doubt this book is a sanctioned review of the Johnson heirs. This is the 2nd or 3rd book I've read about America's wealthy elite and sadly, they all sound tragically alike. People without jobs and direction flounder to find purpose in their lives. Few find it in the solace of religion or any other worthy, yet non-lucrative means.

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"I have other ""drive-in"" tapes from Madacy and am quite happy with them. TRACK OF THE VAMPIRE sounded intriguing, and the price was right. I was all set to lambast this film, until I read the other reviews and was informed that there was footage missing. I love 50's trash horror, bad acting, etc. , but I wasn't prepared to be as bored as I was. I guess I don't equate bad acting with sleepwalking. And what was with that overlong deal with the dancer on the beach? Suddenly, it was over. On came a Betty Boop cartoon. I thought OH JOY! The cartoon wasn't even that good, though Ms. Boop showed maximum cleavage and overt sexiness, apparently before she ran into trouble with the Hayes code (1932). Surprise! The second film, NIGHTMARE CASTLE was blessedly interesting. Directed by Allan Gruenewald (real name: Mario Caiano) and starring the wonderfully confident Barbara Steele, we have here a film of great style, if not substance. Though poorly dubbed, fans of this genre don't really care. I didn't. Lotsa schlock & silly stuff entertained. Upon further investigation, I was interested to find out that TRACK was actually pasted together with footage from a Yugoslavian film and originally released by AIP as BLOOD BATH. Forget this version of TRACK, but CASTLE is definitely worth a look. Quality of print is also questionable. Madacy did a much better job with BLOOD CREATURE/WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family."

I'm almost 48 years old and I've been reading this series since high school. I have most of the books in paperback and as of the last couple years, on my kindle. I'm thinking about starting over reading them again. I can't even put into words how much I've enjoyed, over the last 3 decades, the Kinsey Millhone series. I would recommend this to everyone who likes a good detective or private eye series. I've laughed, cried, got mad, and felt a sense of happiness when the bad turned back to good. Sue Grafton was one of the best. I will forever be grateful for the distraction from every day life she gave me over the last 30 + years.

It is very interesting to see what happens in the world of the fictional characters.  This book is still very good for the fans of historical fiction.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction.I love this series. It has all the elements of a good thriller, but with a twist. I'm not sure if I would recommend this book to everyone, but I'm not sure I would recommend it to a loved one.Good book, great characters and a good story.This is a very good book. I like the fact that I don't have to deal with the emotional pain of having to deal with the guilt and shame of the loss of my beloved child. I also like that the author is able to present a clear and moving view of the family. I like that the story is based on the facts and the family that had been through such a traumatic time. I like that the story is told through the eyes of a very strong woman.

As she is getting ready to meet him, she meets the man who is doing the same thing to her.  The man tells her that he is interested in her and that he is looking for her.  She does not trust him.  She is in a difficult situation and she wants to help him find out what his baby's name is.  She is in danger and she cannot stay out of the situation.  She decides to follow him and help him find the baby's name.

The book is a good read.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  You will be in love with this author.

The author has a great way of telling the story.  She uses lots of language to convey the emotions that she feels.  She gives you a feel for the place and the people in the book.  I liked that the author did not use words like ""bored"" or ""drugged.""  I liked the idea that she used words that had no meaning.  I think that her story was written by a woman"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"'Say Die Strom (is that what it is?).  The film is a turn-off for the young (and the old) people, and the social class.  It is very much like a family movie, with a good script, good acting, and a good story.

""Die Strom"" is a great family movie, and I hope it continues to be like this.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I have a hard time finding anything that could have been better.

If you like family, you will love this movie!  It is a movie that is well-made, well-acted, and well-written.  The only thing that is missing is a good dose of humor.  This movie is not for everyone, and it should be avoided at all costs.

A good review is provided in the DVD section.  You can view the entire movie in its entirety.

To conclude, this is a great family movie.  The acting, the story, and the direction are excellent.  The movie is a must-see, and it will be enjoyed by any family.  I recommend it to anyone who loves family.  I don't care for the negative reviews.  I love family movies!I love this series, the costumes, the music, and the story.  This is an excellent collection.  I highly recommend it.This is a very good movie, I would watch again and again.  I know it's not going to be a very good movie but I just love the acting and story"

Dang.

My office chair, which gets heavily used, would settle slowly towards the earth in the course of a day. And then need to be raised again. So I replaced the cylinder with this one with this one.

Unfortunately... my chair is still settling slowly towards the earth. Not as fast. But still doing it.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,Nice grip and weight on these darts. Case has plenty of room for spare tips and flights.  I chose to go with shorter snub tips and rarely if ever do i bend or break one.  Would buy this brand again in a heartbeat.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"If I remember correctly, this product has many great reviews which encouraged me to buy it. I love that it's made with wood and will last a long time. My four year old is very interested in it and we have attempted to play with it several times. The felt puzzle pieces that create the roads come apart very easily. This causes many problems as one begins to construct the city unless you are very delicate. The city itself must be built on a flat surface, so no carpet. This is very challenging with my two year old around. Even if she wasn't there to knock things over, it seems like it would be difficult to play with the city once set up. It is not designed to be very sturdy."

Though no one who reads Atwood should be surprised by her orderly, logical, deeply considered characterization, Grace Marks is a new high in Atwood's repetoire. Atwood's word play also flits around the book, and riffs on certain terms reflect and reverberate with studied meaning. I won't spoil it any more for you. It's an excellent book.

And instead of a warning to them, and in the world where the Catholic murder of Christians in Serbia so recently (oh, is that just a big silly thing that should be put in ""histoical context"" also?) is known to so many--- one wonders.

Comes with a carrying bag, I laughed when I thought of taking it apart. However I did because I returned it. Here's the real honest truth, cheap ,flimsy and over priced. The smaller tower was less frustrating to assemble, in the photos it shows areas where the inside poles Velcro to the tower. No, there are ties and do not stay in place. The tower that's supposed to attach to the other part with a loop and button thing, does not stay connected or flush together. My poor daughter was so upset since she was getting stuck between the 2. The other side of the tent isn't lined, the poles which Velcro the cover to the house at the bottom pop off. I really can't say anything nice about this item."

Blade is 12C27 stainless steel, GREAT quality steel. Grip is ergonomic and the rubberized finish provides great purchase on the knife.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either."

I will admit that I have been tempted to buy an online game publisher for a while and then wonder if I could take it as a personal investment. However, in this case, it is very clear that this is not the case. The author's writing is descriptive and entertaining. There is a lot of action and suspense. I was quite surprised to see that the author is on a new series that involves a new character, Ms. Reeder, who is a former CIA operative, and who is also a journalist. There is a lot of depth and mystery that is evident from the characters' actions. It is interesting to see how Ms. Reeder, who has been in the military for a while, has become a journalist. The story is well written and the characters are well developed. The plot is well developed, the characters are well developed, and the story is well developed.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"As part of my significant renovation throughout a recently-purchase house, I bought this faucet for my bar sink just two weeks ago.  This faucet was extremely easy to install.  Since I did not have to remove the old faucet (there was no faucet at this sink when I bought the house), it took me all but 10 minutes to have this up and running.  Just put the whole faucet through the sink hole.  Screw in the mounting plate from the below.  Hook up the water supply hoses and you are set.  Please note that I am a fairly typical DIYer not expert, so I think most anybody would be able to install this faucet.

My experience with Amazon has been great.  The box arrived quickly.  Although it is advertised as oil-rubbed bronze, the color is fairly light not as dark as some of the other bronze faucets that I have.  In fact, the picture on Amazon is a lot darker than the actual faucet.  There were also no hoses included with the faucet, so you will need to buy them separately.

Overall, it's a good buy, but only time will tell how it will hold up."

They are made of quality metal and look great in the eyes. The size is perfect and the quality of the material is outstanding. The bottom line is the glasses are a great value and they are a great investment in your home. I recommend them to anyone looking for an adjustable night light that will fit in a home that uses night lights. I hope I will have a few years of use with them. I have them on my ceiling fan and they work great.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Excellent book for basic practice.  I gave only 4 stars because the glossary often doesn't contain words that are used in the text....really, a minor objection since there are excellent sources on the web; and because rarely the translations are wrong...but in those cases it is obviously a misprint.  Again very minor objections.  Because of this book I am buying many of the of other PMP series.  On the more important positive side, it has a lot of exercises with answers in the back and is very thorough.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"Let me preface this review with noting that I absolutely LOVE books where a dog or animals are the main or central character.

The Art of Racing in the Rain is nothing more than the political, social and anti-science commentary of the author who disguises such as being told or observed by Enzo, the dog in the book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially given the many rave reviews this book garnered, but I was highly disappointed with many aspects of this book.

Analogies to racing (automobile) are exceptionally redundant, and the characters were, I thought, not well developed in the least. The story plods along with Enzo seeing the world through his eyes (and the shortcomings of not possessing thumbs), which had promise; but unfortunately the author uses the canine as an outlet for his own political and social commentary.

Yes, there were a few chuckles throughout, but sadly, the book is more a success of exceptional marketing rather than exceptional writing or storytelling.

As mentioned, I love books where the dog or animals are the main character(s): If Only I Could Talk, White Fang, The Call of the Wild, The Wind in the Willows and many others. Unfortunately, The Art of Racing in the Rain, although it held promise, falls very short if you are a fan of these types of books."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,"Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

I love it. I have a German Shepherd and a Shih Tzu. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that they don't have to worry about the front part of the collar getting loose. The collar has a really nice reflective ring on the front which makes it shine a bit more. I like that it's a little thicker than my other harnesses which is good because I have a dog that is a lot lighter than I am. It's also a little heavier. I wish it had a little more padding on the front part.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking to add variety to my breakfast with egg, ham and English muffin sandwiches. I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set."

Now it's ready to go - from unpacking to the kid riding around the house, under five minutes. Because of the wheel design, it can spin, and move on smooth floor or carpet. There's also a bumper on the front of the pillow racer to prevent running into walls or tipping forward.

All in all a cool little toy!"

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I love the look and comfort of this jacket.  It's nice and warm and I like how I can change it up - hood with fur, no hood, no fur on trim, etc.

I am 5' 10"" 135# and have broader shoulders.  I ordered the medium and it is a bit snug across the shoulders, but still allows for some movement.  However, I probably won't be able to wear any thick sweaters underneath. The arm length is perfect (some medium jackets are short in the arms for me).  I think a large would've looked too big everywhere else.  I like that you can tighten the cord around the waist - to give you some definition of your waist.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"The author, a secularist, does not bother to treat philosophical arguments for God's existence seriously. For example, he lauds Bertrand Russell's attack on the cosmological argument (p. 185) when, in fact, Russell created a straw man. In ""Why I am Not a Christian,"" Russell says that cosmological arguments all fail because they depend on this premise:

P1: Everything that exists has a cause

Or order to reach this conclusion along with one more premise:

P2: The universe exists.
-------------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God)

But Russell claims that C1 (God) would be subject to P1. God would require a cause for God's existence. If so, the argument fails.

This is absurd because I have never read a version of the cosmological argument (in 35 years of studying and teaching and writing about philosophy of religion) that used this argument premise. Of course, P1 will defeat a cosmological argument, but no one uses it!

For example, the kalam cosmological argument reasons this way:

P1: What every begins to exist, has a cause of its existence.
P2: The universe began to exist.
-----------
C1: Therefore, the universe has a cause (God).

Notice that the kalam's P1 differs radically from Russell's version: ""Everything that exists has a cause."" God, of course, did not (by definition) begin to exist, so is not subject requiring a beginning cause for God's existence. In order words, there is no reductio ad absurdum. Neither do the Thomistic or the Lebinizian cosmological arguments rely on Russell's manufactured premise.

One could go on about the cosmological argument (I devote 30 pages to it in my book, Christian Apologetics), but suffice to say that this book does not bother to critique the argument at its best, only at its worst.

That is a very bad sign indeed, but I find that many British secular philosophers are often dismissive of philosophical theism. Shame on them."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update August 8, 2012:

We've had this product for about a year now, and I'm still really happy with it.  It's definitely full from my dog, but we have not had any overflow issues.  I'm just about out of the powder that comes with the unit, so I'll need to get some more.  Otherwise, it's been a really convenient product to have.

I would suggest that you seriously dig the depth hole that they recommend in the instructions.  The deeper the better though as sometimes the dog poop will fall down in the hole when you flush the unit with water.

Original Post:

In all honesty, I was a bit pessimistic when I first got this thing a few months ago, but I was desperate enough to buy it.  Thankfully I did, as it's been a great addition to our household and in keeping out yard (and garbage) clean.

The unit is real easy to install.  Just dig a hole, shove it in, fill it up with water and the enzyme they give you, and you're off.  I am lazy with the unit, and normally just pick up our dogs (we just have one) poop on the weekend, and then every month flush the unit with 5-gallons of water and add more enzyme.  The thing seems to really be working.  We have dog play dates regularly, and the unit seems to be able to handle it.  Also, we're currently reaching 20 degree nights and 40 degree day here in Seattle, and it seems to still be working.

While this thing holds a lot of poop, I'm pleasantly surprised that there is not a horrible stench (sure it has a slight poo smell, but it's not gagging).  Definitely would recommend this unit to others who want to dispose of their dogs waste in their backyard."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My in laws got this for our son who is one this Christmas. He absolutely loves it! I put together a pros and construction based on my opinion:

Pros:
- it has three different paths it'll take depending on which position the rail switches are. This keeps it entertaining.
- very easy to put together. The instructions are very simple to follow. It is a little time consuming because you have to screw in nails about 15 times or more throughout. It probably took me about 30 minutes.
- it is well structured. I'm not too worried about it falling apart anytime soon. My one year old is pretty rough with it and it doesn't even flinch.
- comes with two cars (one boy and one girl). You can also use different cars to that you may already have like hot wheels and the smart wheels cars. Our kids have all kinds that they use.
- Even my 5 year old enjoys it. Sometimes I have to remind her that she needs to let her little brother play with it.
- No batteries needed! We all know that's always a plus.
- let's kids use their imagination! Any toy that allows kids to do this is a plus for me.

Cons:
- It is a bit large. We live in a apartment and this takes up a lot of space. It's about 37 inches tall and 18 inches in width. If you have the space, won't be an issue.
- It doesn't have two entrance paths so the cars can't race. This didn't seem like a big deal but my 5 year old has been taking about this, so I thought I would add that in here.
- There's a lot of pieces when building so for some it may be overwhelming. Don't worry the pieces all are numbered and colored so very easy to identify when building.

Overall, I would highly recommend this toy for little children. Even adults can have fun with it."

There isn't much in the way of a plot - a struggling father and husband buys a new bicycle in order to carry out the duties of his new job, the bike is taken away buy a passing thief, and the father and his son go out into the poverty stricken streets of Italy to find it.

However, it is a journey that they will never forget, as they bond with one another, and the father's weaknesses are ultimately exposed out of an act of desperation. It is an ultimately heartbreaking ending that caps off one of the best films that I have ever seen.

You owe it to yourself to see this one. Thank God that the people at Criterion cleaned it up, and gave it the DVD release that it deserves."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"These trains arrived promptly all in a tiny see thru plastic zip top bag. They are slightly larger than the trains that came with my Mexican train domino set, but just barely. I purchased these when my teenager lost 6 of the 8 trains we had and we had only played a handful of times. I waited for months hoping the trains would show up. Low and behold within days of buying these trains she found the lost trains. Figures, right?

Now we have a lovely selection of the solid colored trains that came with our game and several more to choose from!  Solid, clear colored ones and some with glitter, something to appeal to everyone. I didn't think the train colors were ugly at all as some reviewers said. And if you should get an ""ugly"" color in your batch just think of it like the most unplayed token in Monopoly, it's really not the end of the world. They are sturdy little trains and are very similar to the ones that came with our game, no complaints here. *would like to include a picture but on my mobile I'm unable to do so,  I'll try again soon."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This might be my favorite celebrity memoir audiobook to date, simply because Martin Short is so freaking entertaining. On second thought, that's not the full reason why I loved this one...

While the narration performance was expectedly funny and entertaining (Short does a ton of impressions, including some of his most infamous charactersEd Grimley, Jiminy Glickas well as of his many celebrity friends, and he sings!), there were also some unexpectedly poignant and heart-wrenching moments captured too. Short spoke candidly about pretty much everything, and I have concluded that the man has the memory of an elephant because he was able to recall events and moments in his life dating back to his childhood with such pinpoint specificity, it was truly astonishing.

These read-by-the-author comedian celebrity memoirs have become my favorite things to listen to on audio. Even with the ridiculous name-dropping and chronology and details of things I don't remember or never even saw, I love how they give you both a performance and a real look inside the heart and soul of these entertainers.

If you are a casual fan of Martin Short, who I now feel like I know well enough to call ""Marty,"" treat yourself to I MUST SAY on audio. You won't regret it.

Danni feels betrayed by her boyfriend Taylor and moves to Shifter Grove, where it not only calls to her, but she is able to realise her dream.  Taylor doesnt give up though  he is relentless in his pursuit.  Danni, meanwhile, finds trust, friendship and love in Shifter Grove.  Rhett and Rush have returned home; they are billionaires but know that money cannot buy happiness.  They have made a promise to their father, and there is no way they can go back on this, irrespective of the consequences.  Danni has forgotten what it is like to date or how to get to know someone again after Taylor, but fate plays a hand although it is not all plane sailing.

I did like the fact that the opening scene was so short. I liked the fact that the movie took place in the 1950s. I think that's a bit of a stretch to say that the movie takes place in the 1950s. The first time I saw this movie, I was in a different time, and it was kind of depressing. It took place in the 1950s, and it was a bit of a shock to me.

Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars. If you want a super durable knife, that is strong and American made, get an actual Ka-Bar. They are about the same price depending where you get it."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."

It was labeled as being W38"" X L32"", which is what I do need, but they felt like these were 36"" waist, which means that I need instead a 40"" waist. This means that I have to return these and I have no way of knowing how to do this. The style of the pants were good, though."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,An amazing tale of different cultures and people. I loved it. I would recommend it. I read this book in one sitting. The characters were great. I enjoyed the story. It was a good read.

Books_5,5.0,OR,Well reasoned analyses of political problems accompanied by logical conclusions  and probable outcomes.  Thoughtful portraits of recent historical figures and their significance.  Moving personal stories. Great humor and wit. Tremendous honesty runs a course throughout the book.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,Perfect! Keeps my kids from hitting their head in the tub
Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"OK, good air combat scenes. That's out of the way now.

There is no discernible story worth caring about and NONE of the actors roused me to root for or care about them. The movie just goes on insufferably from one disconnected, disjointed scene to the next.

There is no structure to this film other than a loose stream of scenes and unattractive people, especially Sgt. Yu who's supposed to be so hot everybody wants her. She's sullen, somber, withdrawn, sour, and even that is limp and lame.

Occasionally inspired cinematography, some nice little shots, small vignettes, nothing any film school grad should not be able to do.

I'm out of stuff to write about. NOTHING here. NOTHING going on. I turned it off at 48 minutes.

In fairness, in reading the other reviews, it seems Asian fans and others got a lot more out of it than I did, so maybe it's cultural. OK, so I'm old school, USA---REALLY Old School.

TOP GUN, it is not. Tom Cruise and Val Kilmer? No.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This skirt runs small. it is listed as a size large and by the sizing chart it is suppose to fit someone size 12-14. well im a small 14 and it is far from fitting me. it barely went over my hips and i was scared it was going to tear. I was hoping to wear this for a wedding this weekend but thats not going to happen. I would say the sizing is more of a size 10. There were no labels on this except one on the inside that had a 5 on it. nothing else. no care instructions or anything. I am on a weight loss journey so im going to keep it and make it my goal to get to. The inner material reminds me of slip material and it was clingy but that also might be because of the sizing..but it did seem to have quite a bit of static. The outer layer is a very thin see-through material. it is where the design in printed and it is very beautiful. the inner layer is about a foot shorter than the outer layer. The belt tie is my favorite part. It has beads and is made with real feathers. You can feel the stem in the fabric of the belt. over all if this skirt fit I would love it but until it does i just like it.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,CG,"I generally love these kinds of boots, they feel comfortable and they are also very comfortable.  I highly recommend them.  I am a 32D, and these are a bit large for me.  I ordered a size large, and it fits perfectly.  I ordered a size XL and it's just a bit loose.  I can't wear it with a bra underneath.  I just went with the XL and it's just a bit loose.  I would not recommend these for any other purpose.These are great.  I love the fit.  They are a little too tight, but not too tight.  The only negative thing is that the fabric is a little thick.  I'm 5'4"" and 140lbs, and they are a little short in the torso, so I'm going to keep them for a short while.  I'm still wearing them, but not as much as the reviews suggest.  I like them a lot, but they are a little long on the torso, so I might have to order another pair.  I'm going to wear them with a navy shirt underneath, because I'm very picky about the colors.  I will also be wearing them with jeans, but not on maternity wear.

Books_5,2.0,OR,"I really hated Annabel's family with all my tiny heart and soul. And I did not understand why Annabel just didn't go work in the fields by herself and leave her family to their own devices. That was really odd and kind of annoying.

Other than that, this book was decent enough. It's not the worst one I've ever read. I think there could have been a lot less bashing-you-over-the-head-with-religion, as in, it could have been much more subtly (and thus skillfully) done.

Stephen's character could have been fleshed out a lot more. He was kind of just in the background for most of the time, and so the part that focused on him didn't have as much impact as it could have. I like le Wyse and I liked Annabel, but their relationship was a little ""eh."" I loved Eustacia but thought she talked like Yoda. Most of the language in this book was a little weirdly done. I get that the author was trying to evoke the 1300s, but she didn't pull it off unfortunately. It just came off weird and it was very distracting to read the characters talk like normal people and then say ""Nay."" It reminded me of that John Pinette sketch ""I say nay nay!""

I thought the storyline with the baliff was well done, though I could have lived without Gilbert and Adam's characters. Same with Beatrice - did that actually have a point or not really?

This is a good, light read for when you just need a book that doesn't require your brain to function."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Gayle Lynds definintely has some talent, but as an avid thriller reader, I found her plot and characters too unbelievable--in fact I felt as though I were reading a cheesy romance writer's attempt at murder and mystery.  Everything was just toooooo contrived, from the CIA head, to the Carnivore, to the look-alike cousins, to the clown disguises, to the evil doctor.  For me, this was not a ""page-turner"" and I only finished it because it was loaned to me by my best friend and I had to find out how Lynds wrapped this all together in the final outcome.  Unfortunately, the ending was also lame.  I believe Gayle will get better with practice and I would recommend this as a good airplane or waiting room read if you want something glitzy that doesn't take much power of concentration."

The main character Sherrif Longmire is wonderful. And the back up characters all add a lot to the stories - naturally Henry Standing Bear being a huge hit, as well as Vic.

This is well thought out, fast moving, interesting back story, well written - he has a lovely way with words and so funny. I have had some really laugh out loud moments with these books. Very dry clever humour. I love it!

I would highly recommend this series to anyone, even if you think a 'Western' theme is not for you. It's really intriguing and wonderful characters."

This story is told by three different people but don't be like seriously is a bad way because it made the story. We find out all of the truths.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,I loved this item. The design is nice. The colors work together well. Its most definitely good quality and made to last a long time. My puppy didn't have any issues with putting it on or wearing it. He was really chill and comfortable. He never tried getting it off or biting at it. Not even once. Although I will say I do wish there was a zipper or a button or just something on the part that goes around the neck. My puppy did not enjoy getting it off. I honestly think it hurt him a bit. So since I took it off I haven't decided if I will ever put it back on. Other than that its a great quality item.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review."

I'd  faux-painted my cabinet tops to look like marbel ( people can't tell the difference...I'm an artist), but after some months the thin coating I'd put on top of the water-based layers of paint  to water-proof it was failing.  I'd tried several different products, but they just didn't last (with  the dishes/pots/pans I put on the counter top).  This product has lasted and has given a great shine.  It's tough!  After a year, there is some wear on the side of the sink where I put most of my dishes/pot/pans....... but I can just put on a few more brush strokes of this stuff and it blends perfectly.  In fact, I've corrected some of errors in the past of poor brush strokes........with a few strokes (top to bottom of the counter of course to create a complete brush stroke).  Blends right in."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"This is an awesome product.  I love the materials and feel of this bottle.  I just wish it had a little more plastic, but that is the only reason I gave it 5 stars.I had no issues with this bottle. The size is perfect and the handle is very comfortable.  The straps are very comfortable and the bottle is very easy to hold.  The bottle is very easy to put on and take off.  The only negative I have is that I have to press it to get it to open the mouth.  I know that sometimes you need to press it to get it to open but it is really difficult to get it to open.  It is a very difficult bottle to open and to close it.  It is very easy to put on and it is super easy to clean.  It is very easy to clean and I would recommend this to anyone.My only complaint is that the handle is a little snug. I like the idea of this being a little more rounded. But that's not the case. I use this for traveling so I would prefer to have a little more space.I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs. She loves it and has had it for about a year.  She has been using it for a couple of days now and loves it.  I also think that it looks great.  She likes that it is more than she bargained for.I bought this for my son who is 5'10"", 150lbs.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This book might be useful for someone just digging into the issues of residential heating and cooling.  It's presentation format doesn't presume the reader has much prior knowledge of the material, which dovetails nicely with the medium-level details of the material.  I consider it a pretty decent overview, but by the time I had read it, other materials I had covered made this book redundant."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,CG,"Just as Karloff, Lugosi and Rosario Dawson are the most talented in the world, the other three are the worst.  The movie is a mess, the acting is terrible, and the movie is a sad little movie.  I would have liked to have seen more of the series.  I don't think I would have gotten it.  I hope they make a sequel.  I wish I would have known more about the show and the characters.  It's very sad.I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch this movie on TV, and I was a little confused by it.  I remember watching it with my friends and my grandkids.  I had never seen this movie, so I didn't know what to expect.  I was a little worried that they would find out the truth behind it, but I was a little disappointed.  I don't know why the people who did this didn't get this movie, but I guess I just didn't expect it to be so funny.  I guess it was supposed to be funny, but I guess it was more like ""One More Time"" and that would have made it more interesting.  I guess it was just a little too far fetched, but it was worth watching.  I think it was really good.  I think that people who are not interested in the movie should watch the movie and not buy it.  The movie is pretty good, but I would have thought that this movie would have been better if it was a little more complicated."

I have had them for a few months now and they are very comfortable and will hold up to the elements for a long time.  They are not very strong and have a tendency to flex the little bit too much, which is why I put them in a shop.  I am happy with them so far.They work great. We bought a couple of of these for our garage to replace the old one. They are great. Very bright. I have been using them all day and the only drawback is the metal screws are a little too long for my small hand.Works as advertised.This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material. The other pair of these are a little smaller, but it is still very well made.

The ""One-Tenth of the Price"" rating is very nice for having a limited amount of light, but if you are looking for a quality item, I would recommend these.

Books_5,1.0,OR,"As archeological and other scientific disciplines push the stories of the bible further and further into the realm of mythology and spiritual allegory (where it really belongs, rather than a literal account of events in ancient times), books like these are popular among those desperate to 'hold the line'. They serve as some kind of proof or affirmation that the biblical accounts were based in 'fact'. Frankly, this sensationalistic volume, claiming that a bunch of large rocks on a mountainside 'prove' that Noah's ark actually existed, is just the sort of evidence that a religious person would treat with skepticism and scorn as extremely frail, circumstantial and shabby if used to prove that a biblical event had *not* happened. About as much validity is attached to the author's work as that of Von Daniken."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,This product is great and works well. It is thick enough to make it hard to throw. If you want to throw a tennis ball then the plastic part should be strong enough to go through it. It is a perfect size for my dogs and is perfect for them. I have 2 dogs with medium to large chests and they have never had problems with this ball. I just put it on them and they go to their feet. It is very easy to put on and take off. The only thing I wish I could do is let them just sit on it and it would be a good thing for them to not have to do that. I would definitely recommend this product. This is the best dog bed I have found. It's lightweight and is comfortable for my dog. I have used it for the last 10 years. It's well made and the only thing that bothers me is the fact that it is a little hard to put on but that's not a problem with the other dog beds I have used. My dogs go to the bed when they're hungry and this one is a little bit tougher on them. This is the only catnip my cat doesn't like.

The club, like many drivers and fw woods, is a bit too long for average height and wingspan.  The shaft is very flexible - dunno how it compares to ladies or senior, but you can see it flex as it moves.  If you buy it, make sure you close the clubface at impact and not just address.  If your hands finish too far forward and leave it open, you're gonna get a monster slice.  But if you hit it straight, you'll get good distance for the $."

However, we are trying to be gentle with it. My son and I like to play bowling with it as well as air hockey. We have soft, stuffed bowling pins and just use them as the pushers and the soccer disc as the puck down our hallway. My son also enjoys spinning it around and watching the lights in motion. Even my 2 1/2 year old enjoys kicking it. It is a tad bit noisy on our tile floor but I wouldn't say it is too bothersome."

You can get them in a wide variety of sizes and textures (soft chewers, puppies, power chewers, etc.). You can stuff them with a never-ending variety of treats, so your dog won't ever get bored. They're easily washed as well - either with your fingers, or in the dish washer. When my dogs see these, they go crazy! One of the best ""bang for your buck"" options out there."

It was a fun movie.
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,2.0,OR,"I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This book was a recommendation of my reading group. Having never heard of Elizabeth Peters, I was surprised to find that she's a prolific author with many best-selling mysteries and is an expert in Egyptology. This is the first of her Amelia Peabody mysteries. I quite liked this book. It reminded me somewhat of the writing of Agatha Christie. The story was written around English characters with the same language and general ""atmosphere."" I was happy, however, that the story didn't have the same ""pull a rabbit out of a hat"" ending that Christie was famous for, although Peters seemed to be emulating that. The ending wasn't a big surprise.

I enjoyed the story, and the main character is portrayed with with and strength. I loved that a woman of that time period was strong and feisty. I am bemused by Amelia's friend and companion, Evelyn, who faints at the drop of a hat. Who does that? Perhaps her corset was too tight. The writing was good, there was NO foul language or explicit scenes. I would classify this book as a ""cozy."" And while it was good and well-written, it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat, unable to put it down, so I give it four stars."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Nobody's Fault was very well written and the author uses descriptions and dialogue with expertise and care. The story itself was told well and the loose ends tied together nicely in the end. The author wove multiple points of view from different perspectives about the same incidents and gave us a clear picture of what each character felt and saw and why. Despite all that, I still came away from Nobody's Fault feeling sad and more than a little ticked off. The title is wrong... it was clearly the husband/father's fault. ALL OF IT WAS - any man that walks away from his marriage and children to live with another woman so he can be ""fulfilled"" with ""true love"" is  a sleazeball. When those kids are grown and gone you can find your own freedom and a new life if that's what you need to. But to walk away from your wife, leave your children to live in a single parent home for your own emotional needs? Selfish beyond description. As for the feelings of his new love, the other woman? I had no sympathy for her in any shape or form - so she fell in love, so what? She knew he was married and she trespassed anyway. None the less, I will read other work by this author on a different subject matter, she definately knows how to tell a story."

The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

UPDATE:  The knife has been back in the USA and I haven't had to return it yet.  I'm very happy with it. "

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"From the beginning episode of season 1, I was hooked on this show.  It's a nuanced series of tightly plotted stories with a running series of subplots that slowly build from the beginnning.  The individual stories are not always what they seem - from the outset, the viewer knows that not all the people Reese and Finch try to help are victims - quite often, they are the perps that Reese has to stop before they commit whatever crime they have planned.

Of course, there are some clunkers but even the bad shows are superior to a lot of the dreck currently being aired on TV - broadcast or cable.

Before the show premiered, Jonathan Nolan, the series creator, called it Batman without the cape.  And, like all good hero/anti-hero franchises, this show has its own support 'family' as well as a marvelous rogues gallery with some enemies fixed seemingly permantently in the mythos and others appearing and eventually being handled.  Some, such as Elias, a mob boss out to control the NY rackets, start to slip into the show with mentions episodes before the character appears.

Many of these allies and rogues carry on into the new season which successfully opened with the resolution to the season 1 cliffhanger.  The flashbacks continue to reveal the backgrouds and motivations of Reese and Finch as well as the supporting cast - good guy or bad guy.  Fortunately, unlike producer JJ Abram's earlier success ""Lost"", this are much more defined & explain more - propelling the episode along.  (I love ""Lost"" but the flashbacks and flashforwards did get a bit confusing.)

I watched season 1 again then season 2 before season 3 premiered (several mini-marathons involved).  Each time I watch it, I see or hear something I missed before that enhances the show.  Some even have significance as the series goes on.

This is one of the very few Must-See shows for me.  And the only one on one of the big 4 networks.

And I'm already planning to buy season 3."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Leaf 0 bag. This bag compresses well and easily fits into my hiking pack's sleeping bag compartment with room to spare for my clothes for a weekend backpacking trip. I camped with a lean-to tarp configuration instead of a tent. The temperature dropped to about 35 overnight. I got sweaty in the bag because I sealed myself in it completely (head and face) which caused moisture to build up in and around the bag and allowed me to get cold. However, I'm confident it would keep me warm in the same conditions if I kept my nose and mouth outside of the bag when sleeping.

Overall, this bag looks great, feels comfortable, packs away small, doesn't weigh much, and is warm.

I would recommend to a friend as a backpacking bag."

It's easy to clean and easy to put on. My dog loves the little plastic ball inside, which he uses to put treats in the refrigerator. I put it in his bathtub, and he loves it. I am very pleased with this purchase and will purchase again. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for him to stretch out and play. It's small enough to fit him well enough that he doesn't get too far out. My cats love this food. My dog is about 20 lbs. and he was very picky about his food so I would give this a 5 star rating. However, he was not crazy about this food either. He liked it because it was dry and was easy to digest. However, he did not like the taste. He is a picky eater so I gave him a free bag of this food. He didn't like it because it was too dry. However, he will eat it if he gets a little bit of it. I will definitely buy this food again."

I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!  It's easy to clean, it has a removable lid so you can keep your pot from burning, it's easy to clean and I can use it on my stovetop.  I don't have to worry about it burning up!

We have tried it out in the yard and the dog seems to really like it.  It is just too big for him, but he is a great chewer.

The problem is that plastics are so ubiquitous and cheap.  How do you replace them without - at the very least - going broke?

You watch prices on Amazon.  These are really small jars.  The set cost about three times as much as the same-sized disposables, which means that in two re-uses, they didn't owe me any money and after three, they were putting me ahead.  Yes, my kid has to remember to bring them home.  But they don't break easily, and, because I can microwave in them, they save on dishwashing, too.  I wish the lids weren't plastic, but this feels like progress."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"These function well however they aren't ideal for fixtures where the bulb is visible. The light from these bulbs is concentrated from a small spot in the bulb and as such has an intense, bright light if it isn't covered with a shade or diffuser. Also, the bottom half of the bulb is white plastic. If it's something that bothers you, they don't look great when the bulbs aren't actually on."

The figure stands up okay, but is clearly not as stable as many of the male sculpts (which tend to be in wider stances to begin with, and have larger feet).

Some have complained about the paint, and I agree it could be better, but mine has no deal-breaking flaws. There's a picture floating around these reviews of a Ripley with a big dot of paint inside her right hand. Mine has one too, but I think it's actually supposed to suggest the back of her rifle's grip, rather than being a paint error."

The two-way mirror is a nice addition to my bike, especially if I can use the reflective lenses to reflect light into the sun. The lens is very thin and it is easy to hold with a pair of sunglasses. The glasses have a flexible outer shell that provides a good amount of light for cycling, which is nice for a beginner. I am happy with the quality of the product and would buy again.

The only downside I have is that I don't like the color of the lenses. I have had no problems with them being scratched, but I would have liked a better color.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,1.0,OR,"This mount doesnt have much good stuff going on.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"If Jean-Luc Godard hated commercial film producers, why did he make a movie for them?  To make some adolescent point about how he, The Brave Artist, would never be cowed by the vulgar likes of Carlo Ponti or Joseph Levine, I suppose.  And to prove that he could get  Brigitte Bardot as naked, or naked-er, than her ex-husband Roger Vadim.
Somehow, though, I suspect that even Vadim would have done better by this material than Godard.  After all, he has a good cast (Bardot included), good source material (a novel by Albert Moravia), and the services of Raoul Coutard, one of the best cinematographers in the history of film.  And what to we get?  About 90 minutes of mind-numbing agony as Godard plays film-school in-jokes and stretches scenes out to tedium mostly to prove that he won't truckle to commerical interests.  But none of this adds up to real drama, either.  As a result, any honest audience will have to admit that they've been cheated, too.  And unlike Joe Levine, none of US owned the screen rights to THE CARPETBAGGERS . . ."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Sometimes you read a book that you just devour. You inhale it. It consumes you. This is what The Perfect Life did to me.

I must back up and say that this is the first book by Erin Noelle I have read. Not bought. Read. Ive had a few of her books on my Kindle for a while and I have a few in paperback. I really could kick myself for not reading her books sooner. I mean really. I was totally missing out. I just went and one clicked two more.

The Perfect Life was perfect to me. A book that took over my life for the time I was reading it. I finished it in one day which is a rarity for me. I couldn't put it down. I was consumed by it and the characters.

Its the perfect story with the perfect characters and perfect writing. Its unique and creative and has something added to the plot I never would have thought of.  I literally felt this book in my chest. And no, Im not exaggerating. My heart raced, I felt anxious and I felt the intensity between 2 Oliver and Monroe. Their attraction and chemistry is unbelievable.

The characters are so lovable. They are broken and imperfect yet perfect. I want Oliver in my life. His quirkiness is beyond adorable. Hes fun and sweet and romantic and charming and I adore him.

The Perfect Life brings up some serious topics. Life isn't perfect. For anyone. What appears on the outside isn't always how things are behind closed doors. It also tackles some other real life issues which I won't get into as not to spoil it. But it does so with grace and tact. And mixed in with the heaviness are moments of tenderness and love, and wit and humor that will have you smiling and laughing.

I loved it. All of it. The Perfect Life is perfect!! You won't regret one clicking. I promise."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

I'm trying to figure out if the other reviews and I read the same book.  The story was kinda disjointed.  The conversations between characters didn't feel like any conversations I have heard before, not at all believable.  Almost like reading a book badly translated from another language.  Weird.  You wanted to sympathize with Tony because he was trying to do the right things for his daughter, but his thought process didn't fit his character.  Cassi is sometimes way to flakey to be believable.  The book is rather disappointing."

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Wesley Snipes plays an undercover CIA agent in Romania. Pitted against this perpetually angry hero (whose emotions are delivered with bland voice-over) is a sexy and strong-willed Russian beauty played by Silvia Colloca. Snipes must protect Colloca going back to USA from the attacks of the villains of this country, whose motives I'm still trying to figure out.

There is no denying that this is a low-budget action film made in Romania, kind of film you watch for shoot-outs and explosions. To their credits, the stunt persons of the film did a decent job and in one memorable scene a baddie falls out of the window (of the second floor of a house) and falls onto the roof of a van below, hitting his head against it really hard and bouncing like a rubber ball. That is amazing. And don't forget the cat-and-mouse chase scene in the subway where a bald-headed baddie shows one surprising stunt.

But the rest of the film is very dull. ""The Detonator"" uses every clichd element of action genre taken directly from other better films, and throws them into the convoluted narrative in the wrong way. The film attempts to be different with a portrait of a gangster who owns a soccer team and several scenes about soccer games. However, it just doesn't work because of the tepid descriptions of games and banal action sequences mixed with them.

It was in 2004 when we saw the third entry of `The Blade' which was not bad. But now Wesley Snipes seems to have officially joined in the direct-to-video land where Steven Seagal is the king or the Great One. (In fact `The Detonator' is co-produced by Andrew Stevens who is also responsible for such films as ""Half Past Dead"" ""The Foreigner"" and ""Out of Reach."") I'm not saying that all straight-to-video actions are bad - remember Dolph Lundgren who is doing a very good job as star and director. - but as to `The Detonator"" the result is simply disappointing."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"If you've got a kid who is building cars in the garage they might be okay putting this together, but I'm thinking it's more for adults, both because the game Destiny is not a kid's game, and because there are some very small parts and somewhat complex instructions. At any rate, I would recommend the builder be at least 10-12 years old depending on skill level.

My wife got this and was overjoyed to begin putting it together. She found the instructions a bit frustrating at times, but had it put together in a few days with no help from me, and she's never really done anything like this before so she was surprised that she took to it so well (she really just wanted the finished product but seemed to get really into the building process from my perspective).

There are extra parts that come with the model, and the finished product is mighty cool (though a bit subdued in color, but that's Destiny for you). When you are done you'll have a nice block model to display but I wouldn't recommend ""playing with it"" unless you want to see fragile broken pieces all over your house.

Recommended for Destiny fans who are also builders with moderate skill and enjoy assembling models. Worth the price if building models like this is your thing."

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I am so angry. Frontline DOES NOT WORK. Idk where all these people live that frontline actually works, but they must not have many ticks. We live in upstate New York, where there are lots of ticks. I thought I was being a responsible dog owner and religously following the instructions and applying frontline. Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING. We switched to the seresto collar and its MUCH better! Dont waste your money on frontline. I have half a mind to sue them."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I'm discriminating. Willing to pay for better/best quality. However, I planned to use this for a Disney Trip (2 adults, 2 kids) and I wanted a carry on as a back pack (to free my hands for car seats), then a smaller back pack for the park (instead of just a wheeled backpack only which would have been much bigger in the park than I wanted). This was fantastic. No problems on domestic flight with wheeled part (with day pack zipped off). Fit no problem straight in. Squishing straps great. I did NOT have much trouble with the pull arm as some reviewers, slight sticking at times but better than most of my luggage (NOT as good as my Victorinox for a comparison, but still very good). Zippers heavy duty and work well. Day pack holds much more than I expected, more like a true backpack (I had expected a little larger than a fanny pack. This is MUCH larger than that.). Water bottle slots hold CamelBak style bottles fine. Little compartment at top for earphones, charger, inhaler, medicines and front compartment held sunglasses, wipes, sunblock stick, snacks, etc. Main compartment had two rain jackets, two sweaters, magazines, sandwiches, snacks, baseball caps. My wife didn't really have to carry anything in the park. Even with all that, it slid right under the seat no problem, with room for my feet still. Some noted trouble zipping the day pack onto the main pack when full. I didn't bother as it has a nice ""hold a bag"" strap (like the Victorinox) that worked great, so didn't bother zipping on. If both full of hard objects, I could see some trouble, but if relatively flat, should zip on no problem. However, look around!! I found for just under $100 elsewhere. For that it was a steal. For the $175-200 range, I still think it is worth it (now that I have it). Bite the bullet, you are really getting two really good bags for one."

Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"Don't get this if your goal is the secondary temperature gauge.  It doesn't transmit through walls!  So you would have to have the main unit in the house on one side of a window and the receiver somewhere outside mounted but not in the sun, oh and not where it can get wet, oh and not too far away, etc., etc..  There are tons of restrictions about the placement which make the secondary temperature gauge virtually useless.  Who has the PERFECT spot to mount it in relation to the main device?  I thought you could mount the temperature gauge anywhere outside but you can not.  Can't be in the sun, can't get wet, can't have X number of walls or barriers between the main unit and the other gauge.  I actually should have sent it back.  Would not recommend unless you don't care about the second gauge and if that's the case, you can find one cheaper."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I use this as bunny litter. I was using the Carefresh one for the longest time but I find this one to be cheaper so I've since switched to this one. As far as odor control this isn't the greatest, after all it is technically bedding, but I have found ways to help it capture the odor. All I do is simply pour the Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer baking soda onto the bottom of the litter box under this bedding and it works great to capture the odor.

I recommend to use this as bunny litter if your bunny/rabbit is litter box trained because that's what I do and it's been working out fantastically."
Electronics_5,4.0,CG,"The drives work fine, but the ones I bought were a bit slow.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking for a large hooded box to fit a particular sized space and this box was the right size.  I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.  This saves lots of time especially in the morning and reduces the amount of litter residue that ends up on my clothes before I head off to work."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,CG,"Overall this is a great pair of shoes. I've worn them for a couple of hours and they are still comfortable. The only negative is the soles are a little tighter than I expected. It's a little hard to get them on with socks. The shoe is a bit too tight for me to wear them with socks. If I had to go up a size I would probably order a half size up. However, I think I would prefer a half size up since I don't have a lot of room to wear them with socks. I'm sure I could have gotten a size up if I wanted to. I'm not a big fan of the color and the soles are a little too tight for me. I've had a few pairs of this brand before, but I have no regrets. They are very well made and they're very well made. I would highly recommend this brand. My daughter loves these shoes. She loves them."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These are strictly for water aerobics. For that purpose that have a nice snug fit.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking for a sturdy waterproof camera for my daughter. I wanted a good quality camera that could stand up to the mishaps of an eleven year old. She is in love with this camera because of all of the neat features that it has. She is able to take selfies with the frontal view of the camera allowing her to see herself. It is shock proof and so far it stands up to that fact as she has dropped it several times, knowing at times she can be clumsy this camera has given me the tranquility to know that this camera will outstand some of the abuse.

The down side that I have found with this camera is that it uses batteries and no charger. We fixed the problem by buying recharger batteries, which is great because she uses the camera quite a lot. Using a 2gb seems to go pretty fast, so I definitely recommending to get a bigger mini memory card. This will help from needing to remove or transfer pictures to another device. The batteries seems to hold for the usage, so don't be scared that it won't last long. Definitely recommend the product!"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"These things are great. They make short work of hole cutting thru steel. Just be sure to keep oiling the hole as you go.

With a VERY STEADY hand they work fine in a hand drill ....but much better in a drill press"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This movie was much better that I was expecting. It had some great one-liners and is the 1st best comedy of the year. Ice Cube and Kevin Hart were perfectly matched and played to each other's comedy style very well. Hart plays Ben Barber, a jumpy security guard who plays video games and in love with James's sister, Angela. James hates Ben and wants nothing to do with him. When Ben is accepted at the police academy, James decides to take him on a 'ride along' to show him what the police world is really like. Throughout the day, James gives Ben silly assignments that no one else wants. It all leads up to a confrontation with Omar, the main villain that James is obsessed with catching. If you want a good comedy, I highly recommend RIDE ALONG!!!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I really couldn't, this book is excellent! I kept wanting Dove and Sarai to find out her parentage, since they wanted to know so much about Alanna, but no. Next book! When Alianne, or Aly, daughter of Alanna the Lioness leaves home, she misfigures a vital piece to her plan - pirates. Pirates capture her, shave her bald, and sell her as a slave. To prevent being sold as a 'bed-warmer' (someone for the master to sleep with), she dives into danger to become damaged. She is finally thrown into a deal free, and becomes part of a kind family - one that is in the misfavor of the king. She becomes chosen by a trickster god to protect the children of the family. The climax rises, especially when a crow turned human just learning about romance decides he wants Aly for his mate."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"The information in the video is good.  The problem with the video is production.
This is a series of Jason Martel's lectures that he is just doing a recorded presentation of.  He has a picture in picture of himself talking to you in the lower part of the screen.  The slide presentation has not been optimized for this and his video covers up much of the data (charts, imagery...) he is trying to describe.
More often than not he is staring/talking at his computer screen highlighting parts of the imagery with his mouse instead of the audience.  This could have just had him narrating without the video of him.  I would assume the rest of the DVD series is more of the same.
The audio is recorded over the computer mic and has that very hollow speakerphone-ish sound.  You can understand what is being said, but sound is annoying.
Overall, lots of potential, but a complete fail on delivery."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Just purchased this cat tree a week ago. It arrived quickly and was better than I imagined. The cat houses were large enough for my adult cats. I was worried they might be a little small, but they were spacious enough for one cat to fit in a house at a time and roll around or hide in it. This is my cats first cat tree condo and it won't be their last.

When I purchased this cat tree I saw that there were similar trees for less money, but I chose this one by Armarkat because the reviews said it was sturdy. I must admit this cat tree was easy to put together and it is extremely sturdy. My cats jump on and off and climb it without any wobbling. I have two cats and both are about 13 lbs. The carpet material is a little on the cheapy side, but the cats enjoy it so I can't complain. I purchased the Kong catnip and sprinled some on the cat tree and my cats are in heaven and happy to be up off of the ground. I purchased the 74"" tree and was concerned it might not be tall enough to make the cats feel secure, but it's plenty tall and spacious too!

If you are looking for a sturdy tree that your cat/s will enjoy I recommend this product by Armarkat."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I only rated this iPad case 4 stars because I did not have anything similar to compare it against. However, I will say that I can find no fault in its design or its ability to do the intended job. I can't imagine there is another unit that could perform significantly better. It appears to be well made, rugged, attractively designed, and easy to use. I recently changed from a cover which had a keyboard built into it. That unit worked fine, but I found myself more often than not, using the onscreen keyboard. This is a much simpler cover that looks and performs nicely. I like the ability that this cover gives you to adjust the angle of the screen."

The cups are super simple to use and the eggs come out perfect every single time. Clean up is a snap. I highly recommend this product.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"While Case intends their knives to be pocketknives, they have the quality and look of a fine collectable. The Stockman model gives you 3 good blades of varying size and shape.  The large version weighs an ounce and a half more than the medium size and is 5/8 of an inch longer.  The additional size and weight can pull your pocket out of shape.  The amber bone  has an excellent hand feel and is a joy to hold. The blades are very sharp. Stainless steel will require less care to keep rust away but still hold a good edge.
A Case knife is a possession to be treasured that will be with you for years. Case is an investment in a quality knife that will become a life-long friend.  In a world of cheaply made knives from overseas, American made Case is a beacon of quality. For over one hundred years, this company produced quality knives.

The bike is pretty small, so he doesn't really have a lot of room for it, but it fits a little snug. I like that it has a couple of pockets on top.

Frankenstein

Just did not work -- the beginning, middle, and end do not come together

While Branagh gets to show off his athletic torso that is not enough to save the film.

Something between Branagh & Helena Bonham Carter doesn't work.  They have no chemistry together?

There are so many things in this film that do not make sense.  For example, Frankenstein cuts off a head to use for the monster & uses a different brain.  So why is the monster's face a patch work of stitches?  Apparently, there was no reason why Frankenstein would use a different lip or cheek or eye, but the stitching was supposedly scarier."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"So glad I bought this.  Went on vacation and came back at night time on a rainy day.  My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.  If I didn't have this my only choice would have been to call a plumber late at night on a Friday and pay ridiculous fees for an emergency visit."

Rose has been kidnapped and taken to Hell, she is being held by Razor at Basiliuss command. Of course, we know Rose isn't going to take this lying down. With the help of friends, both old a new, a rescue mission has launched.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"In the previous installment of the Heroes of Olympus series, we learned that Percy Jackson, much like Jason in The Lost Hero, has lost his memory and is at a camp for demigods that he's never known of: Camp Jupiter. As with most of the books in both The Heroes of Olympus series and the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, we begin at the camp (though the Roman camp operates very differently from Camp Half-blood) before embarking upon a seemingly impossible quest. Rick Riordan never misses an ingredient in his books. Adventure? We've got that in spades as Percy and his new friends, Frank and Hazel take on monsters, Amazons, gorgons, and giants on their quest. Serious shtuff? Well let's see. Both Frank and Hazel have had issues with their families, Percy can't remember the rest of his life, and there's that itty-bitty little ""Gaia's trying to take over the world"" thing they've got to contend with. Romance? Got that too, just a bit. Annabeth is all that Percy really remembers and. well, I don't want to spoil you. Let's just say that's a pinch more crushiness (I'm making up words now, deal with it) than that. And humor? Um, hello? Percy's back and he's always been sarcastic and a little hilarious. Frank and Hazel aren't missing a sense of humor either. When the mood gets a little darker it doesn't last long, one of them will either crack a joke or Riordan will throw in a hilarious villain to break it without interrupting the flow of the story. Basically, The Son of Neptune did not disappoint. Overall Rating: 4. 5/5. Greek mythology lovers and fans of Harry Potter (especially the earlier books) are sure to love this Middle Grade series. - See more at: [."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I like that this doesn't have corn syrup and petroleum jelly in it. I had been using the regular Laxatone and Lax'aire products, but not for hairballs for softer stools. My kitten, now a year old, has had an ongoing issue with extremely dry stools even though he eats 1/2 wet 1/2 dry diet (wish it were all wet food) and apparently doesn't drink enough water. Anyhow, he loved the taste of the other two as I'd just put some on his food dish and he'd lick it up so there was a concern he wouldn't like the natural version. Thankfully he loves this just as much crying for it as soon as he sees me reach for the tube.

As for effectiveness, neither of the other two seemed to help soften much although I feared giving him too much as I didn't want him to become dependent upon it for bowel movements.  It does make me feel better giving him the natural version. We'll see if it helps soften his stool as thus far even giving him about two half inch servings a day hasn't seemed to help :-( And, I really hope none of the ingredients are bad for kitties...

Update as of July 5, 2014: This product HAS really made a difference and my kitten is no longer in distress or crying when it's time for a bowel movement. It's comforting to know this natural product has made all the difference versus the original product. I give him about 1 inch twice a day. He continues to lick it up as I just put it on his bowl. His sister won't eat it, but she doesn't have any need for it either."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I purchased this toy for my daughters' birthdays (4 and 6), as a shared present, and they love building with it.  This is usually done as a ""group"" project, as some of the pieces are a little bit difficult to snap together for them (but honestly, I have trouble with a few of the pieces myself), but it's been great to see them working together and collaborating on a building project.

I was at first a little worried about whether or not all 400 pieces could be contained in the tote.  Opening the box for the first time dispelled that concern.  The box looked practically empty!  The pieces are very small, and barely cover the bottom of the storage box.  However, don't let that fool you, since you can build lots of things from this seemingly small sprinkle of parts.  The fact that they claim to be compatible with other snap-style building blocks is a bonus.  In any case, there is room for plenty more pieces, should you choose to buy more.

The downside of this toy is that the some of the pieces really are difficult to put together and take apart, and require a good deal of dexterity to do so.  However, given this fact, the finished products are pretty durable because of it.  I remember skinning my fingers as a little girl taking apart my Legos, though, so I'm thinking this might just be a right of passage."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"Temple of Doom is infamous for its suave, yet violent scenes.

The film has a weak plot.  The movie is based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little too much of a hack job.  This movie is still fun to watch.  The only problem with this movie is that the monsters are too scary to be scary.  They're just too big to be scary.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the voice acting.  You'd think that a scary monster would be scary, but it's a little too scary to be scary.  The movie is probably the best part of the movie, especially if you like zombies and vampires.  It's just too scary to be scary.  If you're a fan of the film, then this is probably the movie for you.  You can't go wrong with this one.  You can't go wrong with this one.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,CG,"Wish I could leave a comment on the quality of these bulbs.  These bulbs are bright and the light output is very good.  I also like the fact that the bulb is made of plastic.  It is not waterproof so it will not last long.  I would not recommend these bulbs to anyone.

I did get a free sample of these bulbs at Amazon.com.  I will be purchasing more to try and find out if they last long.  I will update if I find out if they last long.  I will update if I find out if they fail.  Thanks!Good quality, great price.  Seems like a great product.I bought these to replace my old and new 5/8""x5"" drills.  I've had no problems with them.

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"I am a horror genre junkie, and whereas I really loved The Blair Witch Project, I really disliked this. I walked away from the theater, which had 6 other people in it, going seriously, I paid for this?? Even my 19 year old son wasn't impressed and he scares easily. I kept waiting for the feeling of fear to hit me and it never did. I looked at my phone to check the time and it was an hour in already and nothing fantastic had happened yet.

My 24 year old daughter saw it before me and told me you had to believe in order for it to scare you. I do believe there are spirits and hauntings, yet I couldn't get this movie to scare me one bit until the very last scene, which I won't divulge and ruin it for people. Every time the story line would move toward scary, it suddenly shifted away.

I watch shows like A Haunting and Extreme Paranormal and in my opinion, those are scarier than Paranormal Activity. I wasn't impressed and wanted my money back. My husband wanted to see it and I told him he'd be better off to wait for it to hit DVD and watch it then. If you haven't seen it, rent the movie before you buy it."

The last thing alternate captain, Ryder Carrigan, wants to do is participate in a bachelor auction.  However, when the two meet they might have more in common than they would have expected.  This contemporary sports romance is suitable for new adult and adult audiences.

I like Ryder.  He is serious about hockey to a fault.  I appreciate after Ryder was called out by one of his teammates, he realizes that he needs to achieve more balance in his life.  This is a valuable life lesson that can benefit everyone.  I felt bad that Jessica was blindsided at the auction, but I love that her friend bid on Ryder for her.  They have some obstacles to overcome that make the story interesting. The two have great chemistry and make an excellent couple.

At ninety-seven pages, this story is a fast and captivating read that I finished in one sitting.  I enjoyed the charity scene in the beginning and thought that was a clever way for the characters to get together.  Chasing the Prize is a fun story and entertaining read.  Im looking forward to Casey and Charlenes story next in Book six, Making an Impact."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"I ordered this tea set last week, after reading many reviews and contacting Green Toys. I asked the company about the leaky teapot problem which was mentioned in several lower-star reviews. A company representative responded, assuring me that the design of the teapot had been changed to fix the leak problem.
It is evident that the leak problem has been fixed; it no longer has a seam around the middle of the teapot that was causing the leak problem. It should be noted that the lids of the teapot and sugar bowl are no longer interchangeable; the teapot lid is much bigger than the sugar bowl.

I love that the set is cute, made in the USA, dishwasher-safe, able to hold liquid, and came in awesome packaging (even though that only matters when you first get it, it's so nice to have the frustration-free packaging! Why can't every company package items this way?)

I originally gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because:
  The tea set seemed smaller than I thought it would be (but it's actually just right for my 2-year-old, so I actually wouldn't want it any bigger)
  The green plates are  a lime green instead of the soft pastel pictured
  The teapot lid isn't as pictured (but is now leak-free!) and isn't interchangeable with the sugar bowl lid
  While the set appears durable, there are some small flaws that appear to have occurred in the manufacturing process. My daughter tripped and fell on the sidewalk while carrying a teacup and the plastic is scraping off a little bit from where it hit the ground.
  You may need to have your toddler hold the lid while pouring. It stays on with careful, gentle use, but also falls off sometimes.
  It could be priced a little lower (say $15-$18 instead of $20).

Bottom line: Definitely worth getting, not quite perfect. I would still buy this tea set and am happy with the purchase."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"When I was a little girl, I had a wolf ring that I adored bought in some tourist trap Estes Park, Colorado, Keystone, South Dakota, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, someplace like that which I honestly don't remember, but I loved that ring, even though it was a man's ring that only fit on my thumb.  Alas rings that a child can afford are not the best quality and the silver plating quickly wore off my thumb turned green and I could no longer wear it.  When I saw this ring from Moon Wings, a company I have had nothing but stellar experiences with, I knew that I had to have it, but upon reading the other reviews I realized that this ring is very big and clearly a man's ring I changed my size from a seven to a nine and decided it would work for either myself or my boyfriend. It is lovely. There are two things I think the future buyer should be aware of the wolf is not the cuddly sort, he looks to my eye angry and ready to kill, if you are a wolf lover who wants a gentle noble spirit animal, be aware.  Also if you wear this ring as a statement to the viewer of your hands rather than yourself, in other words facing outwards, the little stainless teeth have a real tendency to catch on things and if you wear it the other way to the observer it kind of looks like nothing much just a canine of some description.  I received this product at a discounted price in return for an honest review."

I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a long film, and not for those who have never seen Dracula before, but for those who know that it is indeed a beautiful story, and will watch it over and over.

One bag contains screws with plastic anchors for drywall installation, the other set comes with short, thick screws for wood installation.  First 2 screws went in with ease, but the third screw busted only 3/4 of the way in..the head broke right off!  I know I didn't ""over-tighten"" because the screw wasn't even in all the way!

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:
1)Hard to tell the difference between before and after. Maybe this isn't a bad thing."

After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received an ARC for an honest review. This was a great story and I love that I was able to read all 6 parts together. It would have been painful to have to wait in between!  The story was really involved with politics playing a major role and a tenuous treaty between shifters and humans hanging in the balance. Avelyn grew up in a school for girls dedicated to become mates for shifters. Each girl was assigned to a category of shifter, Fox, wolf, bear, Dragon, eagle. Evelyn was to be a Fox bride but she sabotaged herself by pretending to learn nothing and getting fat and failing interviews with prospective grooms. All she wanted was freedom. She was 3 months away from total freedom when Max Blackmane, Alpha werewolf, came to the school looking to buy a wife. Instead of a wolf bride, he chose the sassy Avelyn, who tried her best to fail,  even trying to run away. But they go to his home together where she feels trapped, unloved, frantic to leave. He is very patient with her and loves her spirit. But he hides something from her that may be his undoing and bring about the downfall of his clan. Evelyn cannot bear injustice and unfairness, so she will go against even her growing feelings for Max to see fairness done. Thus begins a time of terror for the Blackmane family, clan, surrounding villages, Europe, Avelyn's old school, possibly the world as they know it! Got you hooked?? Well, read the book! Besides, Max is hot and the heat between he and Avelyn is steamy! Great book!!"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"A few things to remember:

1. When you use the O Scanner make sure you scan all the way because if you don't it won't tell you the combo name. Also, you can put the medals in different orders and it still will work. You can even have 3 head, 3 torso, or 3 legs medals and they would still work. There are endless combinations you can use.

2. Use Velcro and luggage straps so you can adjust the belt to your size. It's far cheaper than buying the extension belt.

3. The medals are smaller than they appear. In fact I was shocked at how small they were.

4. Make sure you buy all the combos including Burakawani so you can have fun with it. I already purchased the superbest nine medal set and the Burakawani. Yes they cost big bucks but it's worth it."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

Two thumbs up for the Centon SD card!"

Her clever, thoughtful, and well-laid plot really hooks you in, and the characters are so heart-felt that I truly felt I knew them by the end. The resolution was quite satisfying. Highly recommended for anyone, but most especially for thinking readers who like a challenging puzzle (and where the author gives them all the pieces they need to solve the puzzle right along with the characters.) ..."

And then I read some of these reviews in here and one person had the same problems as me. So I  Decided to post my own review. When I get my replacement, I'm not sure if I wanna open her up or just leave her in her box.

I was looking forward to reading the book, but the last part was so repetitive that I didn't get into it. I'm glad it was longer, because it was well written and I can't wait to get my hands on the next book. This story was well written and the characters were believable. It's definitely a book you want to read. This was a good story, but I did have a few issues with the writing."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,I use these at the shooting range and they're just OK. They don't seem to be 29 reduction but I don't know that I can tell that much difference. I like that they fold and they seem to hold up well but they are not as effective as others I have used. I often use foam earplugs instead because those don't interrupt my sighting on my stock.
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This was a good book from start to finish! I started reading it while waiting for my mother to have some tests done and needless to say, I was NOT ready to have to put it up to drive back home. Definitely a book that sucks you in! There were some really intense parts, but there were some really funny parts too, like Sarabeth standing in front of a mirror going ""phew phew"", which if you haven't read it, you will just have too, to see what I am talking about! Can easily be read as a stand alone, but it is the second book in this series. Will be keeping my eye out for more to come for this series and from this author.  I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,CG,"Before i start the review, I wanted to say thank you to everyone who has provided their feedback. I had a lot of feedback from people that had not had a chance to use it yet. It was a little difficult to use for my comfort level, but once I got used to it, I was impressed. I had to work on my breathing so I could get more comfortable breathing. I am 5'8"" and I have a size 10 waist. I have had trouble breathing on the floor because I am too small for my legs. This is a great feature and a great product. I have been using it for a few months now and I am still happy with it. I hope this helps to explain my review. I will update this review once i have the opportunity to use it. I would recommend this product to anyone. I really like these gloves.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"I'm a Huge fan of Will & Grace. I think it is without a doubt one of the best shows on TV. That said this season was about 50/50, and for a show that's previous seasons were 90/10 that doesn't say much. This season for some reason the shows creators decided it was time for Grace to get married. They chose Harry Connick Jr. as her love interest Leo. This decision threw the show completely off the course, and in my eyes changed what the show was about. Two friends.....It became more about Grace getting married, being a newlywed, and trying to deal with a husband that wasn't around quite so much. Karen and Jack remain hilarious as always. Jack continues his career of being a struggleing actor and Karen divorces Stan after discovering he was having an affair with Minnie Driver who was suprisingly HILARIOUS.

The one thing that I will say about this season is that it has some of the funniest episodes of the series. Mainly the season finale which features Karen, Will, Grace, and Jack putting Stan to rest at sea. Without giving away too too much two of the characters go overboard, someone might be cheating, and two characters end up in bed together. By far one of the funniest episodes EVER!

Good show, and just a ok season.....Still worth the buy!"

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I first read Ernest Hemingway as a young college student and missed the depth in his simplicity. Reading him again has turned my opinion around. I urge you to read this book. In ""The Old Man and the Sea,"" he shows the story is not in the language per se, but in the complexity found in the subtle reality of life. Of course, ""Old Man,"" is not subtle in the classic sense. What I mean is that Hemingway doesn't labor the book with fantastic descriptions detailing the intricacies of the sea, or of being a fisherman. Instead, he delves into the mind of the old man, shows the fatherly love he has for a young boy, and the quest for his legacy. A quick read, I finished it in three or so hours. I was captured by the smell of the salt and the slippery feel of fish squirming in a net. I felt the thirst of a long night fighting a huge fish, and the burn of a fishing line running through my hands. I missed the young boy's company late on the boat, and also wished he were to help me fish. How Hemingway did do this to me?

As a Midwesterner, I have barely seen the sea, and have never really fished. It is a great book. Read it for the drama, the language, the psychology, the suspense. It is romance in the sense an old western novel is a romance. By all means, read it. I fully recommend ""The Old Man and the Sea"" by Ernest Hemingway. Anthony Trendl

Uses his experience with computer chess programs to obtain some insights into human-computer combinations for the future.  For example, humans+computers beat humans alone easily and also beat computers alone.  Also, note that existence of computers smarter than humans (in chess) does not stop popularity of watching human vs human playing, or of matches of human+computer vs human+computer -- but no one wants to watch computer vs computer for very long (p. 156)!  My analogy:  we don't watch locomotives race either.  Also, p. 99, suggests that understanding how current chess programs work gives good clues to ways computers ""think,"" and how that is (will be) different from us.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought this based on reviews, composition and price.
I needed a protective case for my portable HDs and in researching, decided to try this model.  I am not comfortable with soft cases and felt that some form of hard case was necessary for protection.
The case measures externally approximately 7"" x 4-1/4"" x 1-3/4"".  The interior storage cavity measures approximately 6"" x 3-1/2"" x 1-1/2"".
The outer covering is a tight weave synthetic fabric laid over a stiff plastic shell.  All observable stitching is single-stitch.  From what I can feel, the plastic does have some give but is reasonably stiff.
The interior has soft, fabric covered foam padding covering only one flat side and not the edges. It appears to be approximately 1/4"" or less thick.  There is a 1"" wide elastic band for HD retention.
The other side of the interior (which has no foam padding) has a mesh pocket approximately 3"" deep by 3-1/2"" wide.
The exterior of the case has a fabric pocket measuring approximately 3"" x 6-1/2"".  There are no straps or velcro.  The material appears to be some form of thin neoprene.
I noticed in the reviews that some mentioned that the zipper can be faulty.  In my particular case there appears to be no problem and zipping the case open or shut presented no discernable difficulties.  Long-term durability remains to be seen..  The zipper pull has a oblong hard rubber tab attached to it.
This case fits my portable HDs with room to spare.  The elastic band holds the devices securely, although how long it will retain adequate elasticity remains to be seen.
I use the exterior storage pocket for the HD cables as I am not comfortable having the cable with the USB connections rubbing against the HD on the other side of the case interior.
I feel that this case is adequate for casual use but I would like to see if there are cases with foam padding all around."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Even though I gave this 5 stars, I am not able to fully review how good the product is for helping dogs with joint problems.  My little dog is 16 years old and is very suspicious of anything different.  He did not like the smell of it, but that's nothing against the taste or quality of the product; he is a very picker eater.  The only way I could get him to eat is was to reduce it to powder and sprinkle it on moist foods that he really likes.  Amazon only gives you a certain amount of time to review the product on Vine, so I had to give up and review it.  The pills are big and a small dog only eats half, but they are scored and easy to break in half.  I really do think that they helped a little, the few times I could get him to eat them, but I think a liquid version of this would work better for him.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"These are heavy duty tubes. I did not expect them to be as thick as they are and I mean they are thick. I installed these tubes on two of my bikes so far but haven't had a chance to go for a long ride yet. But I didn't have any problems with installation. I removed the original tubes and installed these and I used one of the ORIGINAL tubes as a spare in case I do have a flat. I would not use one of these as a spare as they are about the weight of three regular tubes combined.

 I have a Burley trailer that uses 20x1.75 tubes and even ordered tubes for it as I don't want any flats. And even if I do these are so thick that I could probably run the tires flat and still keep going.

I was leary about ordering these at first but at this time I am very please with this product. Just take your time and make sure that the tire seats itself properly on the rim and I would recommend these to others and I will also update my review of them after I get some miles on these tubes.

Since these tubes are so thick and heavy it might take some more effort to pedal because of the rotational force that is involved. I don't think I would use these on my road bike because of that. But for the commuter bike that I plan on riding to work (7 miles one way) or the bike for pulling by trailer it won't matter that much to me. I don't want to fix a flat. If you are planning on riding a long distance (10 to 20 miles or more) stay with the lighter tubes and just carry a spare tube in case you have a flat."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is a whole new way of looking at wood building and other projects. I also bought a fancy jig system, then realized this adhesive is the only thing I need. I lined the inside of a cabinet, fastened a dummy door pull to the closet, and added a 3/4 inch piece of wood to the bottom of a door in less than ten minutes. Very fast and very strong!
  As suggested by another reviewer, I remove the tube after squeezing out an inch of adhesive and capping it. I store the tubes in the freezer in a vacuum sealed jar. Oh, and customer service by Franklin international is awesome.

Edit: After a using it for over a year, I am more aware of the limitations at home and in my beginners woodshop. It did not replace the pocket screws or the dowelmax, but complements them. It is unbelievable when I have 2 clean surfaces to be joined with enough flat surface area to hold. These are critical factors to remember.

The short set time for the 30 and 75 glues, though, means I have to get things aligned perfectly and very quickly--which as a novice woodworker is almost never! I just assembled a downdraft sanding box trying the 300 (5 min set time) which worked better for me on this kind of project. A more skilled person would use it for even more things. the biggest advantage is not having to wait overnight for the glue to set before moving on with a project. You are supposed to wait 24 hours before ""stressing"" it but it is strong enough to sand or whatever within 15 minutes.

 I just used a tube of the 75 (partially used) and a new tube of the 300 that had been stored in my freezer and almost 1 1/2 years past the expiration date. Very good product IMO."

First off, I know a lot of people (ok not in the secret service), but I've never heard anyone talk like the female characters in this book. It feels like they had a photographic memory of a thesaurus when they speak and bring up ten cent words ever so often to let the reader know they're smart. And all the killing. I do believe there's some shady things that go on in this country, but I find it hard to believe all of those killings would happen under the radar. We have such a sensational media, they would be all over stuff like this! If you can get past those things, you have yourself a good read!"
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation."

I was surprised to find that the film is very much based on the book by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, but it's a little bit of a stretch to think about the book and Doyle's characters. The book is a bit too long, and it's a bit over the top. There are some great twists and turns in the book, but there's not much to it. It's very much a matter of style, and it's not about the character. There is some action, but it's a little too fast and predictable.

I actually mounted mine sideways and it feels rock solid on the wall. The buttons feel a little tight, and I question their longevity with repeat use, however, they seem to be of nice quality so it should be fine. There's a filter on the back that can be removed for cleaning, but I can tell already it'll be a pain to get to, given the unit is mounted to the wall. As far as heating, the unit feels a little drafty, but that's how these ones are designed. I much prefer the ones that just emanate heat rather than blowing it with a fan.

Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I have several pairs of Timberland boots and love them all. This pair is no exception. Great quality. Sturdy and durable. Cute and versatile. The only difference that sticks out is that it isn't as comfortable as my other pairs. It's kind of stiff all around (including the foot bed), but perhaps that'll change with more use. It's not a huge issue though - I can still wear these throughout a work day without any problems.

I got the rawhide forty color. The leather is a dark, subtle reddish brown. It's also very stiff and smooth at first, but develops large visible folds/wrinkles very quickly - I think this just adds character to the boot. I can wear these with just about anything.

The sizing is tricky. I'm normally a 7.5 (sometimes 7) and I've never needed a wide width. After reading reviews, I chose a 7 wide, which fit almost perfectly (it's just a little narrow still). So, I think this boot runs slightly long and very narrow. I also have some difficulty getting my feet in them - even with the zipper open, the entrance is a bit too small - but this isn't a huge issue either.

Overall, I really like the boot because it's versatile, cute, and seems very sturdy. I'm just deducting a star because it's not particularly comfortable or easy to get on - but again, maybe those things will improve as the leather breaks in."

I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the second book in the series and I love it! I love the characters and the plot! The two main characters are a perfect combination of fun and sexy. I loved the way the author used the language of romance and the fact that the author did a great job of making it work. The story flowed nicely and kept my interest! I am looking forward to reading more by this author. I hope there is more to come in the series!If you are looking for a little steamy fun, this is for you.

This is a cute story of two people who have been separated in love.

A few things that I liked about the story:

It's short and easy to read.

The characters are well developed.

I liked the story line.

I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a light read.

I have a problem with the length.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I kept feeling like this man must have been to these places where warlords rule. The warlords, the economy, child soldiers all of it was brought to life, but in the context of upper-class America. The book is dark, but it's not actually dark enough to fully bring it to life. However, I think that's a good thing, because the reality is so horrific that it would damage his relationship to his readers. It's enough. I say this as someone who has published for West Point on the subject of warlords. Paolo has the dynamics of the soldier boys down. I kept wondering, ""Did this guy live it?"" which is about as good a compliment as one can give an author.

His creatures are very good. There are coywolves, also called red wolves. That bounced me out of the story a bit, but then I realized that he connected me into the world that way. The genetically engineered creature named Tool was interesting. I found myself wondering how to make him, and realizing that he could be made, one at a time as a chimera, through surgery in utero. Which was a bit of a brrr, moment. The conditioning though, that would be harder.

It's good sci-fi, but it's more than just a story. It gives an opportunity for Americans to feel what it's like to be caught up in such madness. The madness exists today - even now.

The one thing I would have liked though, is for the Drowned Cities to run piracy operations like is done off the coast of Somalia. (It won't surprise me if Libya starts doing it too, but inside the Mediterranean it can't be ignored as much as Somali.) That's a tiny miss to his economy of the cities.

By the way, the Zulus - on theory about this tribe is that they descended from a lost Roman garrison on the southern end of the empire after Rome disintegrated. The garrison became a tribe with roots in military traditions, much like the depiction of the warlord armies of the Drowned Cities."

It was not a bad ending but I would have liked more of the story. It was a very good read and I look forward to reading more from this author.I received this book in exchange for an honest review.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This is not a 'vine review.' Dollar for dollar I do not know of a higher value than this line of meters. If you want a better one but still high value you can look for some of the Uni-t brand meters for ~$20. One caveat with these, what I call ""Harbor Freight"" meters, is that half of the meter leads are trash. You MUST test the leads. I run 1A through the lead and test the voltage across it with a known good meter. If a lead measures more than .2V at 1A it is unusable. I have seen these leads test as high as .6V at 1A. That is .6 ohm. Many of your readings will be meaningless with leads with that kind of resistance. As for the units themselves, they work quite well. I've only had one fail. The display was quite jumpy for some time. Then the readings started to drift very high before the display just went blank. I avoided these cheap meters for years because I did not think I could get a respectable product for this price, but now this is my go-to meter for when I might leave it behind or lend it out and not get it back. When in doubt go for something with better leads to start with such as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Uni-T-UT30D-Pocket-size-Digital-Multimeter-with-Square-Wave-Generator-50Hz-Sinometer-OEM/dp/B005TLXNPO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Uni-T UT30D Pocket-size Digital Multimeter with Square Wave Generator (50Hz),Sinometer OEM</a>"

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)  I also plan to try a ""top entry"" box for the schnook."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Luther Davis wrote and produced this dark, doom-laden 1964 movie.  For me it works on two levels.  In many ways it resembles a Hitchcock suspense movie.  Will the wealthy widow, trapped in a stalled elevator in her home during a long weekend, survive the confinement and the violence and threats she receives from drunks, thugs and hoodlums that invade her home. Watch Olivia de Havilland's face in the final fade out, however, and you'll realize that these events represent a woman being forced to re-evaluate her life.

Previously the focus of her life had been the adored, pampered, 30 year old son who lived with her.  During her caged ordeal she learns that her son wants to leave home, taking half the contents of the safe.  If his wishes are not met, he will shoot himself.

Hitherto, the woman had been living in a kind of enclosed world, unchanging, suspended between two levels of reality.  Now, however, miraculously freed from it, is the world outside the ""cage"" a better one?  Her home is trashed, she has been beaten up by a thug, and her son is threatening suicide.

I believe the final fade out poses this question."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"To Live and Die in L.A. was a film ahead of its time. When it was released in 1985, it failed to connect with a mainstream audience that was put off by its amoral, unlikable characters and downbeat, nihilistic ending. What did people expect from the same man who brought them the equally uncompromising The French Connection in 1974? William Friedkin's film has long been out of print on VHS and so MGM's new special edition DVD is exactly what fans of this influential crime thriller have been waiting for.
Director William Friedkin provides an informative audio commentary that pulls no punches. He goes into detail about the world of counterfeiting and the Secret Service. For those who enjoyed his commentary on The French Connection DVD, this new track is a must-listen.
""Counterfeit World: `The Making of To Live and Die in L.A.'"" is a wonderful retrospective look at how the movie was made. There is some excellent archival, behind-the-scenes footage of Friedkin and his cast in action. Fans are in for a real treat as the fantastic airport foot chase between Petersen and Turturro is discussed, as is the famous car chase on the Los Angeles freeway. This featurette is crammed with tons of anecdotes and new interviews with Petersen, Pankow and Dafoe.
Also included is an alternate ending that the studio forced Friedkin to shoot because they didn't like his original downbeat ending.
There is also a deleted scene that fleshes out Pankow's character a bit more.
To Live and Die in L.A. was William Friedkin's last great film. He has failed to deliver anything on the level of his 1985 film. MGM has produced an excellent DVD with a stunning transfer (including a new 5.1 surround soundtrack) and a solid collection of extras that should please fans of this crime thriller masterpiece."

It is pretty heavy and the fins are hard plastic. I suppose it could hurt to step on, or hit a sibling with, but this is a great whale shark. If you're a marine enthusiast I could see it working as a display for adult collectors as well since it's life-like (not cartoony)."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"One of those increasingly rare ""wow, this is way better than I thought it'd be"" purchases. Barn doors are trendy and seem like a thrifty way to salvage a used door but then you go to buy the hardware and you're hit with a $300+ price tag. So, a $75 option seemed a little suspicious. But I trusted the reviews, and went for it and I'm thrilled with it.

The good:

 - The hardware is hefty and feels 'well machined'
 - it looks good. Not overly stylized so would fit in well in most rooms.
 - installed fairly easily.
 - Came with a matching door 'handle' (which while noted, was something I didn't realize initially)

The minor nit-picks

 - The roller hardware that mounts to the door isn't adjustable in or out. As such, the rollers will hang over the edge of the door a bit so the door isn't balanced on its center of gravity. Maybe this is intentional, but felt a bit off to me.
 - The instructions could have a bit more detail to them.
 - if you are installing this for a bath, note that you will have a gap between the door and frame (see below).

But, again, for $75, those are certainly nit-picks.

As for the bathroom issue, I don't think barn doors are really designed for bathrooms. In my case, I took off the top casing around the door frame and replace it with one that was twice as long. I then mounted the rail hardware to the casing (through into the wall studs, of course). After mounting the rollers and hanging, you are left with about a 5/8th of an inch gap between the door face and the casing. This can feel a bit awkward in a bathroom. I think the fix will be for me to just get clever with the door trim and fir the gap out a bit with some corner bead or the like."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Michael Crichton continues to explore the front edge of speculative fiction in Next, which reads like slices of life turned upside down by the availability of genetic engineering. Crichton explores many facets in parallel stories, bringing in a cast of dozens of characters--many of whom aren't burdened with ethical compass or morals to object to the growing invasiveness of advances, disregarding the physical dangers, and setting perilous precedents that could impact all life on the planet.

Next reads as a morality tale, where virtually every turn is for the worse. Vignettes interplay and rush toward a climax that puts characters on the same page, even if they seem to be thrown together for the convenience of tying loose plot lines. But the real story is a plot of themes. What are the consequences of manipulating complex systems of which man has the slightest knowledge? Just because it's possible, do we have the right to play God in the creative process? Can we foretell the results in emergent research that identifies a single variable in a chain of processes that interact in ways we've barely begun to comprehend? Crichton lays out a case for caution, without turning the book into a pulpit.

The stories in Next were compelling examples looking into the abuses of science. Although stories of talking animals (an African Gray parrot, a foul-mouthed multi-lingual orangutan, and a humanpanzee adopted into family life) were reminders that we're reading fiction, even if several of the story lines borrow from actual cases of genetic precedent. Next shows a causality of legal challenges and life implications of ignoring the dangers of unbridled creative power."

Say Goodby Survival Mode is written by Crystal Paine  is a self help book in a very big market of over stretched moms. This book appealed to me because of it's title and the content as well. The first few chapters was more of a validation of what I was already doing. I did pick up some new ideas in the later chapters. I did take to heart some of what was in this book. Truth be told, this book was a little more religious based then I would normally have been comfortable with.

They're comfortable, though, and will serve as a basic fitness shoe. Moreover, they are fashionable. They always look classy, and this is a style that I don't think will ever really go out of style.

The best part is that they're priced in such a way that I don't feel terrible about replacing them once a year. I blow through a pair of these in about a year, but Amazon usually has one or more colors of them available for a really reasonable price point. This time I went with an all-black style, but I also have some green ones. It's a lot like wearing the converse all stars, but you get a lot more support for your foot. You can buy a bunch of these in different colors, if you want to have fashionable colorful sneakers but you don't want to develop foot and back pain.

And let's face it, by the way -- if you're walking around all the time, doing errands and exercise, and all that sort of thing, most sneakers are going to wear out pretty quickly. At least these are lightweight, comfortable, and fashionable -- and they don't break the bank!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Roman Polanski, born on august 18, 1933, has written a fascinating autobiography. He is a sinner and a genius, a chaotic man and a passionate, he is a machismo and a vulnerable human being, he overcame the WWII, the Polish ghettos and the Holocaust as a resilient child and he lost his wife Sharon Tate and an unborn child in 1969 by the Manson Group massacre, and on the other hand he overcame (as an adult) a special pattern of machismo-self-destruction (with 13 year old girl accusing him of sexual contact). He had lived a lousy life in Nazi-surpressed Polish ghettos and he had lived with too much pride and arrogance in Hollywood, he was arrested in the United States and nevertheless now he releases movies in Paris (presently married with French actress Emmanuelle Seigner). He is a gifted filmmaker and indeed: a writer, better than any crime-author I know; his book, published in 1984, is not a larmoyant, self-pitiful autobiography alike 1001 others - it is an absorbing story about a personality-mixture-hybrid of a Robin Hood mixed with Mac Beth, an Idi Amin mixed with a Mother Theresa, it is the story of ""Roman"" P., who started his life 1933 in Paris as ""Raymond"" P.; the first sentence of his autobiography: ""For as far back as I can remember, the line between fantasy and reality has been hopelessly blurred.""

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this for my dog  and he likes it very much, which says a lot because he is usually a picky dog. This food actually looks similar to corned beef, minus the white colored fat, this just has a spoonful of congealed juices at the bottom of the can. I did think it would have more gravy in it given its sold as a gravy cravers dog food but that's alright, I can add just a little warm water for gravy. Its mostly a smooth pate of food, except the Filet Mignon, that has slight chunks along with the pate. This doesn't smell nasty, it actually does smell quite good. Similar to canned beef stew. All and all, this is a very good canned food for the price. Its also nice that I can have it shipped to my home with prime. Another thing, I wanted to mention, I've seen the reviews others have left saying their dog had gastrointestinal upsets, mine did not, I think it does vary from dog to dog, but I've not had any issues.

Edited 11/07/2015  I bought several cases since my original review because my dog loves this food and its so easy to just have this delivered to my home. I'm happy, my dog's happy and my cat's are happy they have a box to play in.

This model comes with two bands, one black, one brown.  Since my original came with black, I had my husband change the band to the brown.  No special tools were necessary, though it was a little tricky to line up the holes, so I don't think it would be convenient to change the band often.  Stuhrling watches keep very good time with the advantage of not having to change batteries.  You do have to set the time if you haven't worn it in a few days, but the auto wind feature works great and the ability to see the working mechanism from the front and back of the watch is cool."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've bought 3 of these cables. The 1st one was to replace a $230 50ft hdmi cable that was sold to me by the company that I bought a projector from. Someone tried to swap devices and broke the head of the expensive cable, so I bought one of these to replace it and it worked every bit as good as the expensive cable.

When we set up our 2nd theater room, I just went with this cable again.

I have noticed that some blu-ray players work better than others as do projectors/tvs as far as sending/receiving signals over longer distances. The cable doesn't seem to make that much difference - So I'd go with this cheaper cable and still feel safe that it will work for you.

PROS:
The price is great.
The cable is well made and thick
Performs every bit as good as the expensive cables.

CONS:
I did have one cable break that I used in a mobile set up. The cable got a short after repeated set ups and take downs - as long as you don't plan on moving the cable around a lot after it is in place you shouldn't have any problems. The cable was broken when an inexperienced person coiled the cable up after use and folded the neck of the cable next to the head at a 90 degree angle (tightly wound) the cable still works but I have to ""jiggle"" it a little to get the connection to work correctly...
(Not the cables fault - but thought I'd mention in case you plan on using in a mobile set up)

Side note:
Sometimes if the tv or projector is turned on after the dvd player or whatever is sending the signal, I've gotten a no signal message. If I turn the projector on first or turn the dvd player off then back on the signal is picked up. Not sure if this has anything to do with the cable but didn't have that small problem with the expensive cable."

I may wrap it with SeranWrap to see if that will hold them on...I generally prefer hanging trousers by the cuffs anyway to help shed wrinkles.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,CG,"Update
Now that I have used this tool, I feel confident that it will hold up well.  The other two I had to replace, both with the same plastic handle.  I used this to hold up the smaller drill bits in a bit holder.  This holds the drill bits in the bit holder.  I also like the fact that the plastic handle on the drill bits has a plastic handle on top.  I like the fact that the bit holder is a bit holder so that you can flip the bit holder onto the bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle on top.

I'm very happy with the purchase.  I'm going to have to wait until the spring to remove it and use it again.  I have a lot of experience with this tool and I have a lot of experience with the little drill bits and the little bit holder.

I'm glad I got these bits.  I bought them because I wanted a tool that would hold up to the use of a little drill bits in a bit holder.  I didn't need them to hold up, so I just used them.  I'm happy with the purchase.Great price and a great product.The little and the big is not the same.  This is a big tool"

This puzzle is the best puzzle I've seen or done about a county fair.

This is our second Bits and Pieces puzzle and it will definitely not be our last because they are challenging and very rewarding."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This has to be one of the best designed and most comfortable bras I have ever worn! As a size 36DD woman, it is very hard to find something that not only has good support, but is feminine and pretty too. This bra designer understands the needs of a heavily busted woman. First of all, they give you an extra hook and eye bra strap extender to allow your bra to fit perfectly throughout a little weight gain or weight loss. No back fat is going to be created by this band not fitting well. The straps are softly padded over the shoulders, so nothing digs in leaving those red strap marks on your shoulders at the end of the day. The underwire supported cups of the bra give full coverage and also great support holding everything at the right height and in place. They are lightly lined for comfort and concealment and the lace and bow accents are very feminine. Nothing shows through your clothing ~ even the lace overlay on the cups. I believe for me this was a perfect fit - it did not run too large or too small. I would certainly love to have a drawer full of these bras, as I personally could not ask for anything better made, more reasonable priced or with a better fit than this bra. I did receive this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."

I've also read the other books in the series and enjoyed them all. The story was interesting and well written. The characters were very believable. I'm not sure if I liked the ending, but I was just pleased that it went down well.I like that the story is not over. I don't know how you can ruin a book and keep it from becoming a success. I can't imagine I would read a book that ended like this. It's very sad that I'm not reading the other books in this series.

I don't want to give anything away with specifics, but it was absolutely a perfect ending.  The addition of Fallon to this cast of characters was perfect.  I love her so much!"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,"This review is for one of the free books in this series.  This is the first book in the series.  The second book is also free.

This is a short story with a lot of sexual tension.  The story is told in two parts.  The first part is a fast paced story.  The second part is a more mature story.  I liked it a lot.  The story is told from the POV of the main character, Luke, who is a vampire hunter.  The sex scenes are very hot.  I liked that the main character, Luke, was a bit of a jerk, but it didn't bother me that he had a big heart.  The story was a bit different from the first book in the series.  I will be reading the first book in the series.

This book was a good read.  I really enjoyed it.  I was not disappointed in this book.  It was a good story.  It is about a good guy, but also about a bad guy.  The characters were well written.

Bought the HDMI cable to view on my 50"" HDTV, very nice, I think the picture is as good as some of the HD shows on TV or even better. For the price, I feel the HDMI cable should come with it, but oh well what ya gonna do?  Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be. Bought a Tiffen enhancing filter kit and man did it bring out the colors. Built in mic is so sensitive I can here myself breath and can hear the hard disk motor when very quiet, definitely need to get the Canon DM-50 mic.  Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.  All in all I feel it is a great hard drive camera with nice features, however I should of waited another couple months for the new HF-10.

The whole town seemed to be pretty much excited except her. Her heart has been broken by her high school sweetheart, a relationship that ended in a disaster. The last thing she needs was to become star struck.

Until she crossed path with the sexy and charming Greg Moran who arrives in Dogwood together with the rest of the cast and crew of Bittersweet. They had this crazy connection together, but if Cathy was careful to get her emotions in tangle, Greg can be pretty much fickle minded. He can be all in, and then all of a sudden, he was nowhere in sight. He can be interested now, and then appear disinterested the next time. He had some secrets of his own, that I wanted to know. I would have loved it more if he gets his own POV. But I was stuck with Cathy, and her thoughts weren't that bad. There were a lot of bumps before their happy ever after  and there were times when youd just wanted to ask Greg if he really wants Cathy, or if both of them wanted this to work

There were times when I got frustrated with the hot-then-cold Greg  just about everything seems to be perfect, suddenly theyd be back to square one, but still I found this book romantic and endearing. I love Cathy, and her friend Max and Hal  they were a great bunch, and both of her friends are there to catch her every time she falls. Greg was hard to love, but you couldn't resist his charms, so please don't blame Cathy.

When I recently acquired a new 4 pound puppy, the MidWest iCrate was my first choice in new crates to buy for him.  The 24 inch size is ideal for this size puppy and the 12 pound dog he will grow into.  The crate is NOT meant to be used for a puppy that is going to grow into a very big dog (such as a Golden Retriever or Labrador).  It is just not sturdy enough for a big, strong willed puppy.  In that case, get the crate the puppy will need as an adult and use the barrier the comes with it to divide it when the pup is little.

This crate is meant for a small dog, therefore a small puppy. And for that, it is perfect.  The double set of doors allows you to set it up in a variety of locations and still have access for the pup.  We currently have it set up lengthwise with the side door left open for easy access.  The puppy can come and go as he pleases to access his pee pads at night in the kitchen, and then return to his crate to sleep.  He LOVES his crate and willingly runs to it at night to lay down and sleep while we babygate him in the kitchen. When compared to the generic crate that I have, the MidWest crate is made from a higher gauge wire, it assembles together tighter, and it just seems sturdier overall. The plastic pan is a heavier weight and is holding up well.

I definitely plan on always using MidWest crates in the future."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I'm a huge fan of MC books but am not really that familiar with the world of BDSM so I was determined to read this book with an open mind. From the prolog B. b had me hooked to read the story of Colt and Tuesday. I loved that girls attitude from the get go, I loved the way they met and how their world's literally colieded. Their backstories are masterfully intertwined with their present and just made you want to be part of their journey even more and get to know them and the family that Colt introduces Tuesday to. Colts explanation of family to Tuesday is perfect:

""You were raised believin' family is in your name - that it has something to do with blood. ""
""It has nothing to do with that s*** - that's all accidental b. s - the s*** your born into that you can't f***in' control. ""
""Family, are the people who are there for you, who've got your back, and you know dam good and well, you've got theirs too! You don't just run away from them!""

Tuesday has some knowledge of Colts world but from a twisted dangerous point of view, he introduces her to a safe version of the world of BDSM, that has her wanting more. Along the way you learn how his bond with his brother Kash was formed, you learn how important trust can be and the lengths the brothers will go to, to protect their family. I've loved Colts journey so far and can't wait for his brother Kash' to begin."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've used this battery on a D50, D80 and D200. I bought 2 EN-EL3e's because most of my Nikon bodies provide very conservative battery power readings. If you are a Nikon user, you'll probably realize that Nikon has geared their Nikon digital camera bodies with memory card space and battery power meter with a ""glass is half empty"" approach. I was doing a shoot with my D80 and I thought I had a defective EN-EL3e because after 200 shots, the battery meter stated I had 44% battery power left. I ended up shooting well over 1000 shots and the meter was flickering from 30% to 60%. The same behaviour happened with my D50 and D200. Bottom line, Nikon's digital camera bodies have very inaccurate battery level meters. The EN-EL3e has a TON of juice on 1 charge and I am very pleased with it."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Once my daughter saw this at her 3rd birthday, she was not interested in anything else. This helps teach fine motor skills and my daughter caught on right away. She's doesn't quite understand to go from hole to hole in order - she wants to skip all over the board. Also - this is a great relaxing activity for a tired mom to sit with their child and point to which hole to go into next to teach the child.

There are pictures on both sides of the board and the board is sturdy. The animals that come in this are: dog, cat, turtle, rabbit, fish. Some cons that I've found just in the day we've had this are: the holes are NOT smooth so when the lace goes through the hole, it gets frayed a little and is sometimes difficult to pull through the hole. The lace doesn't get frayed enough to dissuade me from purchasing this though. Also, I think that lace should be a little longer. There is barely enough lace to go around the entire animal and with a toddler who doesn't understand to go from hole to hole, a longer lace would be nice.

Overall, I am happy with my purchase. My daughter loves this and it keeps her occupied for 30-45 minutes at a time and is great for a quiet activity at church or wherever. She loves the pictures and the wooden (rather than cardboard) pictures are perfect so we can get a lot of use out of this. Hope this review helps!"

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I enjoy watching ""Lean on Me"", not only because it was a movie where its story has a triumphant end... Cheers to ya' dear ol' Eastside High !  but also the selection of songs, that are peppered thoughout the film-- including Eastside High's School song (which I assume really is their school song) and  ""Lean on Me "" itself, written by Bill Withers, that is always so inspiring when you hear/sing it ...in this film especially !  Wonderful performances especially from actors:  Beverly Tood (Ms. Levias), Michael Beach  (Mr. Darnell), Regina Taylor (Mrs. Carter), and Jermaine Hopkins (as student Thomas Sams). And just to show you how being one in a crowd in a film may lead to bigger acting roles in time, check out actor, Michael Imperioli with the shoulder length hair --one of the hoodlums-- in the auditorium scene.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I received a defective unit (zoom lens stopped working after an hour), and have had the replacement since December, 2015.  So far, everything is working as of February 7, 2016.  The design and features of this camera are impressive.  There are so many functions and modes that it would be hard to learn all of them, but the layout and menu are such that it is easy to access the features you will need and use, and there are 5 buttons that can be programmed to access your most used menu features.  The only ""cons"" I would mention are:
(1) There is a slight motor noise present as soon as the camera is turned on.  Panasonic says this is normal and needed to support the Image Stabilization, Focus and Zoom functions, but this noise is picked up by the built-in stereo mike during video recording modes.  I wonder about the life of a motor that's on all the time.
(2) I would like to have seen a smaller aperture setting than f8, even at the expense of slightly worse sharpness (an unavoidable consequence of physics).

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile."

Installation is easy, takes less then a minute. plus it has an instruction in it. after installed it my 50D looks a lot more professional but camera with the grip plus a Canon flash, it feels a lot heavier. but i can deal with it, and it is not that a big deal.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Ahh...such a pretty cover that contains a book that is really nothing special.  But, I've read the Vampire Kisses series by Schrieber, so I was kind of expecting it.

I actually liked Celeste and I liked Brandon.  Celeste is different than the typical teenager in her crowd.  It stands out right from the beginning.  She goes with the flow because it's the easy thing to do.  She didn't want to loose her friends by rocking the boat.  I wasn't surprised by it.  I also liked how Brandon is different.  He doesn't fit it with either crowd.  It's especially interesting when we learn about his life at his previous school.  I also like the chemistry between Celeste and Brandon, that is until it got a little over the top.  It's like an inevitable part of teen fiction sometimes.

I wasn't particularly found of Celeste's friends.  They seemed so shallow.  And Nash was just not likable at all.  I was expecting a love triangle type of things.  But, Nash was hard for me to swallow.  I also didn't really like the town divided thing.  It just didn't work with the story in my eyes.  The actual legend of the werewolf was different.  It was really tame compared to other stories.  But, then again it fits into the author's idea of vampires in her other series.

So, will I read the next one?  I'm not sure.  This was ok, but it didn't really stand out in any way.  But, the author's other series did get progressively better with each book, so I might give the next installment a go."

Waking Up

by Kirsten Clare

I am a huge fan of both Hideo and Tessa. They were both so young and had everything going for them in a way that I thought was totally unexpected.

Hideo was a fourteen year old boy who had a crush on Tessa. He was also the older sister of a famous businessman who had a crush on him. He was a good guy and was very involved with the club. Tessa was a very vulnerable girl who had no idea she was in a relationship with anyone but her best friend. She was a shy girl who had a crush on him from the very beginning.

The chemistry between them was amazing. They both had their ups and downs and they both had some ups and downs that made the chemistry between them melt. The chemistry between them was unbelievable. It was not a bad book but I would have liked more of the chemistry between them.

Tessa and Hideo had such a great"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Carlos Ruiz Zafn's novel The Shadow of the Wind begins with a trip to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a vast, labyrinthine repository for books of all kinds. Daniel Sempere's father, a bookseller, cautions his son that he must never speak of what he sees to anyone--it's a great secret. Ten-year-old Daniel is allowed to choose a book for his very own, to be its protector and champion and rescue it from obscurity. A mysterious book called The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax catches his eye. He devours the book, but when he tries to find more books by Carax, he discovers that someone has mysteriously been burning all of Carax's works, and his copy of The Shadow of the Wind is one of the rarest books he will ever encounter. One day, Daniel is confronted by a man calling himself Lain Coubert, the devil in The Shadow of the Wind--the man who has been attempting to obliterate Carax's works from the literary landscape. Daniel feels compelled to learn more about Carax. As Daniel grows, his life begins to eerily mimic events in Carax's life.

The novel is an excellent mystery involving the obsession with reading and with true love. Jonathan Davis's reading is superb. If he is not a native Spanish speaker, he certainly sounds like one. The audio book kept me riveted. I looked forward to my commutes so that I could listen to the story unfold. If I have one complaint, it is that the audio version employs mood music. On the one hand, the music was a cue to listen carefully as something very important would be happening, but it needed to be modulated differently--sometimes I strained to hear Davis over the music. As with any audio book, it is hard to go back and easily re-read portions, which is something I really wanted to do as I listened to this book. The story itself can be somewhat hard to follow--it takes twists and turns. However, Zafn brought the streets of Barcelona alive. Anyone who loves books should enjoy The Shadow of the Wind."

Pet_Supplies_5,2.0,OR,"I broke down and bought this mat in a fit of desperation because I was sick and tired of the sheer amount of litter and waste my two 4-5 month old kittens were tracking everywhere BUT inside their litter box! At first it worked relatively well, though the indentations are pretty shallow and don't catch everything. But then my kittens took to picking at the mat, which caused the PVC to shred. So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you."

This is such a good story with a whole lot of potential,but the need for better editing takes that away. This is sexy sensual romance between two very stubborn and strong willed people. The chemistry between the two main characters is off the charts and the writer makes you believe. I love the action between these two characters,I just wish for a tad bit more story and a little more from the supporting cast. The story moves at a fast pace so that you are not bored or bogged down with unnecessary drama. The execution is excellent,you get glimpses of emotions and feelings. This was a really good solid story,one you can not regret reading. I would love to see a revised version and it be released if possible and with a not so abrupt ending."

Electronics_5,1.0,OR,"For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing."

The main characters, Cara and Ethan, are on a journey with a group of people who have been close to each other for years. They have been together since they were little. They have a great connection, but have a different way of talking about it. They have a lot of issues, but they are able to overcome them.

This kind of movie fits my sense of humor - kinda silly and gross in places, but still a lot of laughs.  The humor is definitely 1980s with some pop-culture references that were fun to me, but would probably go over the heads of my grown children.  It was also fun to see some of the actors that I hadn't seen in a few years.  Even my wife, who wasn't looking forward to it, was laughing in some places.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I was a tiny tot--like one of Don Draper's kids, at the time of the events depicted in this season, and this series makes me feel I can make windows into my parents' world, even into their souls.

Dick Whitman's transformation into Don Draper is a brilliant trope, which operates both on the level of metaphor and plot, & is key to characterization.

Even if Dick Whitman had never switched dog tags with his dead commanding officer in Korea, he would have done everything possible to reinvent himself--and obliterate his past.  His ambition drives him into a brave new world in which he, rather like a master spy, must be the bravest.  The new name and social security number make this much more real & palpable, while generating practical complications which fuel the plot and allow us tantalizingly brief glimpses of the bleak world which drove him to his desperate deception.

Poignantly, he hands his half brother $5,000, a large sum in the early 1960's, to, as Dick/Don puts it, ""make a new life for yourself,"" to be another ""Don Draper,"" and vanish from Don's world.  But his brother misses the mark.  For mysterious reasons, he hangs himself.  In doing so, the half-brother's feeble surrender to fate becomes not only a foil for Don's strength, and the boldness of his social/psychological imagination, but an index of the ruthlessness with which he is prepared to ""murder his past.""

Looking at this series from the outside, the sets, costumes, automobiles, & etc., are every bit as authentic as other celebrated period dramas like Downton Abbey.  And in the the social realm, the casual racism, sexism, and class consciousness is perfect down to every dowdy pleat in Peggy Olson's skirt, every limp lock of hair in her bangs, every note of assumed superiority in Peter Campbell's prep school accent.

It's all here, a gripping sixties soap opera that will startle you, amaze you, melt your heart--and freeze it, keep you guessing--and hooked!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I've read this novel twice now, and I can see myself reading it again at some point, thanks in part to prose such as, ""Mortimer favored loud ties, liked his food to the point of fussiness, and bowed and scraped in front of clients in a way that gave the Major his only opportunity, outside of the Sunday Times crossword, to use the word 'oleaginous.'"" There are no huge, cliffhanging surprises here, just very good writing and characters that draw you along and make you wish for the story to never end. I hope Helen Simonson is busy giving us another such well written novel."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"This is perhaps my least favorite collection of Sansone workouts. Along with a handful of old LS tapes, I have Leslie's '5-Day Fit Walk'....which I really like....and 'Ultimate Collection' (yet to do all the routines).

'Muscle Mile One' is your basic one mile. '30 Minute Walk' (also on '5-Day Fit Walk') is good. When I need a fairly gentle workout and want a cast of very real people (not Leslie's fellow instructors or a group of the familiar faces) 'Walk Diet One Mile' suffices (no production value here). 'Walk Strong Express' is my fave on this DVD. Challenging and makes for a nice change with the interval training (and the participants using different kinds of weights).

In search of variety and options beyond the basic four LS moves I was interested in 'You Can Do Pilates.' I'm not familiar with her solo offering by the same name, which has a slightly longer run time, so it may afford more in the way of instruction. Were it not for the fact I have some knowledge of Pilates this would be way too confusing. It lacks detailed breathing and body positioning cues, and, in my opinion, presumes the participant has an intermediate skill level.(As a Boomer, my Pilates faves are Carol Argo's 'Anti-Aging Method' and Maggie Rhoades' 'Pilates Complete for Inflexible People.')

As with some of the other 'collections' the music of these older workouts....upon which I rely to keep me moving and in sync with the workout...is weak much of the time. The sound quality from one workout to another lacks consistency, as well. Given my other LS workout options, this one is rarely in the rotation."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"As a lifelong Lakers fan and the absolute biggest Boston Celtics hater you will ever find, I was somewhat doubtful whether I should buy this book. I was well aware of the sports guys almost pathological hatred of great Lakers such as Kareem and Kobe and I did not think he could do a book and be fair in his pyramid ratings of them, nor anyone who didn`t play for the Celtics. I finally got the book and am glad I did. Simmons took plenty of shots at Kareem, but, ultimately gave him a 3rd best player ever rating. At the beginning of the book, Simmons went into great detail as to why he says Bill Russell was a greater player than Wilt, and his arguments and historical proof of his opinion was so accurate that I have to change my own opinion ad go over to the Sports Guys side-Russ was better than Wilt. His rating of Kobe at only the 15th best player ever was ridiculous. With Kobe`s 4th ring won in 2009 (without Shaq to you Kobe haters) was the final hurdle he had to get over to be rated as one of the top 7 or 8 players ever. West and Oscar won one championship each, Wilt and Kareem were the MVP`s on the teams that they did win their one ring on, and Kobe has won 4 and, yet, Simmons rates him behind both of them? Laughable. No sport places a higher premium on the all time status of players being based on championships won than pro basketball. With that truth, Bird with 3 rings, rated way higher than Kobe with his 4. Well, thats just the Celtic bias coming through since Simmons makes quite clear he thinks the sun sets on Bird`s rear end. Oh well, basically the book was fair, it was funny , it was worth 700 pages and would be a nice addition to any basketball fans library."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it."

When using this, if you do big activity with you dog, like chasing a ball with a long leash attached, if they go too far and pulls on this too much, it can come unsnapped.  It has happened a few times while at the park, while the dog is chasing the ball, with a 25 foot leash attached.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I like this. I love that it is lightweight and comfortable.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that it is a bit small and the plastic part on the handle is a bit tight. It is not a problem for me. If I had to pick one, I would say it is a good choice.

I had to return it due to the fact that it is very heavy. I tried to return it to Amazon but they did not respond to my emails. I have yet to find a return option.

The handle is very well made and the front and back straps are very well made. The straps are not too tight. The pocket clip on the front strap is very useful to secure the belt. It is very easy to put on and it is comfortable.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is a great courtroom drama, with detailed analysis of the characters involved. No character is a stereotype, with some approaching pure evil and others somewhat good, but all the characters are believable and their behavior consistent. Turk is very adept at providing just the right level of detail to convey his message. The story and its ending are groaningly realistic. The good guys don't always win, and evil sometimes prevails. Perverted and unusual sex are on display, but not graphic. The message is delivered in good taste, but still delivered. The courtroom action itself is spell-binding, and makes it impossible to break from reading. Give this book a read, you won't be disappointed."

Sadie has agreed to be his live-in chef and assistant, but she is determined not to get involved with him other than professionally. He's exactly the type she always goes for and knows she shouldn't. Sadie gets confusing sometimes. She can't make up her mind, she runs hot and cold. It is entertaining, though. And really, I can see why she's torn. He's used to women falling at his feet and she's a challenge. I really did not want to like Heath at the beginning of the book. I didn't think it was possible. He grew on me, though. By the end of the book I was rooting for him. This ended up being a fun read, with a few tears thrown in. If you like reformed bad boys, I think you'll like this one.

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"Absolutely no customer service, try googling for a company website and you will not find a result. First, after opening the box there was 1 landing skid missing. Second, I tried the propeller guards on and spun the propellers by hand and one for the propellers would rub against the guard. So I tried charging the battery and was going to fly it without propeller guards, landing skids, and without the camera. Plugged the battery in and the drone never got power, no signal to the transmitter either. Tried calling their customer service (which was found on groupon) and they ask to send an email or leave a message. First I tried wrinting an email and after a week I never received a response, then tried calling and leaving a message and after 2 weeks I never received a response. THERE IS NO CUSTOMER SERVICE! Beware of this hoax company. I will now try and google for company webpages before making any further purchases, regarding drone manufacturers. The cherry on top, after handling the body of the drone, the company name smeared from the palm of my hand. Very cheap and not worth the money. This would have been my 5th drone to play with, I have also built my own drones as well. Never had any other issues with other quadcopter companies. Since you can't find a company address or contact a customer service representative, I will probably order a new flight contoller and get it to fly myself, would hate the whole investment to go in the garbage."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This is absolutely a brilliant,entertaining and challenging game,The price is reasonable and will stand up to years of use, either in a home or school-type environment
.However,care must be taken around small children who want to place things in their mouth,as several pieces are small enough to be swallowed. Also you have to be careful not to lose any of the pieces because any loss would render the game worthless. The quality of the game is excellent and the booklet of rules, puzzles and solutions is also excellent The booklet has a coil binding,so it can lie flat,the paper is very high quality as is the colored printing and it will withstand a lot of use. However the solution symbols are very tiny ,requiring lots of light and good eyesight or glasses.
 There are 60 puzzles ,grouped in 5 degrees of difficulty,Starter,Junior,Expert,,Master and Wizard.,each having 12 puzzles. The game resembles Rush Hour..but on Steroids. I would rate the difficulty level as 2,4,6,8 and  10 as the puzzles go from Starter to Wizard. For example the most difficult Starter puzzle,# 12 requires 26 moves to solve,the Expert puzzle # 36 requires 32 moves and the Wizard puzzle # 60 requires 123 moves to solve.
 So,there you go ,suitsable for all ages and puzzle solving skills.
Even younger ones will have fun playing with the game ,by ignoring the given puzzles and simply spilling out the pieces and trying to place them all in the tray,.
 I give this game 5* even though the packaging is not very good. First the package is about 3 or 4 times larger than it needs to be,the ""window"" should have had a heavy cellopane cover ( you can make one),and it should come with a cloth bag for storage or travel ( something else you can make.) It's a good idea to keep those nice bags that come with wine ,cosmetic ,etc.,bottles for this.."

The Chico-Bags finally fixed the problem of leaving them at home -- leaving them in the car -- having too many or not enough....

since each bag wads up into a little light-weight ball of nothing -- and has a clip -- I just clip one to my bag and leave it there all the time.  I keep half a dozen of them in the back floorboard of the car -- when I stop at the store, I just grab them and clip them onto the one already dangling there as a reminder...  I end up with a multi-colored daisy chain of bags.

When I get home and carry my bags of groceries up -- I just toss the empty bags on the table, and when I sit down with a cup of coffee -- I start stuffing them back into their little pouches, and clipping them back onto my purse.

As long as I never leave without my purse -- I never leave without my Chicos.

Haven't been without them since.

And now everybody I know will be getting them for their birthday....  :D

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Back and better than ever!!! I had both Shrinky Dinks and TMNT Toys as a kid and it's so cool that everything is back for the new generation. What's even better now is that the plastic is pre-cut so there's no sharp plastic edges like before. It's little things like that which make a big difference. So does the play set. Wow! It's a 3d backdrop to play with the creations on. There's all the turtles and villains too.

The kit includes the pencils and everything needed to color, create, and play. You just need your own oven and baking sheet. Adult supervision is needed on this one but they can color on their own. It's more fun than coloring in coloring books... so much fun to create you'll want to do it with the kids, especially if you are sentimental for Shrinky Dinks of the 70's-80's.

If you're not familiar with Shrinky Dinks, once baked the little flexible flat plastic sheets shrink, harden, and thicken to become permanent hard plastic play pieces. You can even poke a hole before baking and hang them on a necklace."

It is a good read.I can't imagine what to say about this book.  I'm not a fan of most of the books in the series.  But I love this one.  This book is a must read for any fan of all time.  I'm not going to spoil it for anyone,"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,This stuffed dog is so cute and cuddly!  And who doesn't love a Corgi?  We purchased this dog for our one year old son because it looks like our Corgi.  It was the only stuffed corgi I could find in the tri color.  Our son loves it.  The package arrived quickly and very neatly packed.  We were very pleased with the delivery and  the Douglas company offers stuffed dogs in almost any breed.  Great stuffed animal and fun to snuggle!

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"My wife recently endured ""The Big C"" herself in real life and wanted to see this show, so I bought the first season for her to view.  Having gone through her ordeal with her (and thus being labeled a ""caretaker""...who really took care of whom?, is my question) I sat down and watched these DVDs with her.  This is a very entertaining series!  Bravo, ShowTime, for creating a great show!  However, this woman has problems.  She's in denial, she wants no one to help her, she doesn't want other people to know about her condition...the exact opposite of what my wife endured.  My wife let EVERYBODY know that she had cancer, and as a result friends and family came rushing to her aid; her support group meant everything to her and made her ordeal that much easier to handle.  Three years later she's not only a survivor, and meaner than ever at that (I'm proud to say that I'm back to getting my much deserved weekly beatings), but she's an advocate for other cancer patients who do not have the friends and family to support them in their time of need.  Perhaps the moral of this series is that no one can suffer the disease alone...everyone needs a support group...and by denying her condition to herself and others she's doing herself a disservice.  Watch this series if you want to know how NOT to act if you have the Big C...you'll not only learn a few lessons, you'll be entertained as well."

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,Used this during a trip and it worked fine.  I will keep my review in order to share
Books_5,3.0,OR,"I Heart Hollywood is the second book in the I Heart series by Lindsey Kelk. Angela Clark is back and she's still living in the United States, writing for a hip magazine, and debating whether to move in with her sexy new boyfriend. Her latest work assignment is interviewing fellow Brit and actor James Jacobs...in Hollywood. All is fun and glamorous until paparazzi snaps compromising photos of Angela and James Jacobs. The gossip spreads and threatens her job, reputation and relationship.

I really liked Angela's independent attitude and guts in the first book, I Heart New York. But she loses this burst of ""I Am Woman"" in this book. She seems helpless and clueless. I enjoyed reading more about her best friend Jenny, who is healing from heartbreak and discovering a potential new career. Hopefully Angela just had a temporary mental setback and will be back to normal. As Jenny says, ""You're my best friend. You do stupid stuff. I sort it out. This is our thing, it's the thing that we do.""

Lindsey Kelk's pop culture and smooth writing style make for easy, light reading. I love when a book takes me to different places in the world like New York, London, Hollywood, Vegas, and Paris. It's fun to read Angela's perception of the different cities. It's safe to say I am sticking with this series and can't wait to read the next two.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"My cat cannot get enough of this perch!  I can barely get it assembled each day without her hopping up immediately.  It is easy to move around from room to room, secure, has very soft and cozy surfaces on each level.  My cat is 10 lbs.

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).  The more you screw in the knob, the more air is compressed out of the suction cup, thus securing it even more. So screw that in tight."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"Love this watch. I've got several of their AMW320 and also AMW330 series, and I'm very pleased with all of them. This also comes in a gold version with gold bezel and a white-face version with stainless bezel. I have both.

I consider this a dressy 'snorkel' watch, good for active sports but also dressy enough for a conservative office. The dive bezel works smoothly but moves in both directions, so it's not designed for true Scuba...however I've snorkeled with this down to 20-25 feet and no problems, so it's definitely waterproof for all non-Scuba uses.
Time adjustment is simple. The luminescent hands are quite bright when you first come in from the sun, they seem to last about an hour before fading, so they're for casual use but not, say, serious spelunking. That said, they're easy to read in all light levels against the black. It's a great watch at twilight because you can still clearly read the dial. The second hand is also easy to read in all light levels.

This is a quietly handsome watch at a great price. Solid, reliable like every Casio, but unpretentious.
I've worn mine as a general outdoors sports/beach/knockaraound watch, and it still looks great.
The crystal is completely un-scratched despite some pretty careless treatment.

I'm totally pleased with both of mine. Check out the gold face version as well, and look at the AMW320 series also (same watch style but with a digital time/day/date inset). The AMW320's are equally attractive, affordable and reliable. I have a couple of those too.

There's nothing not to like about this watch. The rubber factory band is fine, but these all really look good on a nylon Nato strap (if you're not familiar with those, google it).
I found mine for around $30 shipped. Prices fluctuate, so do shop around."

I have noticed that there are very few clog styles available right now, so I had few choices. Style-wise, I like the look of the top, the heel is a little frumpy. I like my Walking Cradles with a short stacked heel better."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"On the whole, I like this movie, and the acting is superb. There is a lot of action and an interesting story. I liked the movie, the acting was good, and the movie was a fun watch. Highly recommend it.I can't imagine what this movie would have been like if it had been released on DVD. I can't imagine the level of emotion and attention-grabbing violence that could have been put into it. The acting was excellent. I would not have given it five stars if it had been released on DVD. I'm not sure why the producers didn't make it more than five. I have watched it a few times and I'm not sure how they ended up making it three stars, but I don't think I would have given it three.

I think it's worth the money. I think the DVD version is a very good DVD. It was very well done and was well acted. I would recommend it to anyone. I bought the DVD version and it is good.

I'm a big fan of the music and this movie was a must have for me.I am a huge fan of the Beatles and I loved this show. I have seen this series on TV and this one was on my wish list. I have watched it a couple times now and I think it will be on my list for a long time.I was a little disappointed when I purchased this DVD, but I am glad I did. It's a great movie. It's a fun family movie, so you can watch it whenever you want."

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless. My super playful kitten (loooooves chasing the ""red dot""), tried to chase it for a minute or two, but after a while got bored with the movement and just abandoned the thing."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,Just what I needed to give an old MINI MAGLITE new life. The LED seems to be brighter than the original light and should give longer battery life.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I remember seeing this film so long ago, and the story always fascinated me. Yeah it's an old black and white, but that's what makes it so classic.

Like I said before, I really like the concept of this film."

I expect that they'll get beaten up pretty good on our camping trip, so I made sure all of the lids fit securely.  To check the waterproof integrity, I sprayed water on them and the interior of the boxes stayed dry.  They stack easily and they appear to be very durable.  Overall I'm very happy with the boxes, especially at this price point.  I would definitely recommend them and will purchase again if I find myself needing more."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"If you like period plays then rent this film, the acting is superb.  If you aren't the theatre type then you should steer clear.

Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"My plecostomus devour these (API) algae wafers in no time flat. They apparently love the taste. I feed them these daily and occasionally give them some fresh zucchini. I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"There are few flashlights as versital as this. Streamlight makes this device in many vetsions. I prefer the sportsman model as the tactical ones include an infra red led. If you have nvg's you might prefer the tactical versions.

There is one other big difference between the military and sportsman models. The military ones will start at the lowest setting once activated. The sportsman is just the opposite.

The various colored leds serve various rolls. Red keeps up your night vision, great for not disturbing your partner at night when nature cqlls. Green is the color human eyes are mosr sensative to. The blue is a bit of an anigima. Someone with more detailed info should be refrenced here.

This my 'go to' flashlight. I keep one at my bedside and another in the end table next to my easy chair.

The potholders are very sturdy, and are well worth the price.  I would recommend them.Very nice!  The reviews said it was a great pan, but it's not.  I had to add a second one because I just didn't want to put the pan on the counter top.  I would not have ordered it if I had known I'd be using it.  This pan is well made, and very sturdy.  I am happy with it, and it's a great product.  I am very pleased with this purchase.Very nice to have them for those times when you don't want to have to wash them all!Easy to clean."
Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We use these to get the cat's poops out of the house ASAP.  Love these bags because not only do they  smell good, but they have a handle which makes it easy to scoop and throw away.  Also the box is good to sit next to the litter box, grab and go."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"It's a very pretty bra, and seems to be made out of quality materials, but the underwire is cut too high on the sides so they poke into my underarm. If I adjust the bra so it sits lower, it's too low to offer any kind of support. I would exchange this for another, but I already cut the tags when I realized the underwire problem, so it's too much of an issue to make it worth it."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Awesome movie.  I've always been a fan of the conspiracy movies made in this era (Marathon Man, Three Days of the Condor, The Conversation among the best) and The Parallax View does not disappoint.  While the scene where Beatty pays for a plane ticket while actually seated on the plane certainly reflects a different time, the race to determine the source of the conspiracy and underlying tension of the scenes is palpable.  A young Beatty without all the mannerisms of his future self carries the film with a strong supporting cast including Hume Cronyn.  Unlike many movies in this genre, the conspiracy doesn't consume the acting."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This is the last book in the Learning series and it wraps up the storylines while providing one last emotional tug on the heart. Not to worry if this is the first story in the series youve read, this title can be read as a stand-alone, too.  Chances are though, you will probably be like me and want to go back and read (or reread) the previous instalments. Events in previous stories are mentioned and provide a tantalizing glimpse to the other characters stories.

Grace Hart is many things. She is a cousin, a daughter and a fianc. She enjoys her job, is basking in auntie-hood and is eagerly planning to walk down the aisle with a man she adores. What could be the problem? On the surface, nothing, but as Grace shares her past and the often painful memories she has, it is easy to see the serene faade is hiding a lot of pain. Jonathan Waters, her fianc, is loving, supportive and ready to provide the understanding ear or pillar of strength that is needed to help Grace through the painful journey of discovery she is on. He is sexy, dominant and a perfect partner to his strong, yet vulnerable, fianc. The writing style is natural and flows easily. A few awkwardly worded sentences were surprising but did not detract from a strong story and characters I really enjoyed. I finished the book in one sitting and am looking forward to catching up on earlier books and rereading this story with all the background knowledge this time!"
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,CG,"Alright! Finally, my favorite season of Star Trek ever!  I will admit that I thought this one was a little too long and I hated it. The beginning of the season was pretty much just a matter of the movie ending, which was a little long and seemed to be coming from the writers' imagination. I guess it just seemed like a lot of people were so bored with Star Trek. This season seemed to be pretty good. I don't know if I'm going to watch this again, but I will. I love the characters, the story, the special effects, the acting. I really liked the actors, the humor, the dialog. I just wish that they could have given the actors more of a chance to develop their characters. I would recommend this season to anyone. I really hope that they get a chance to add more episodes to the series. I really enjoyed this season of Star Trek."

definitely worth the $20 or so i paid for it. it installed like a breeze (note that it'll fit into a slot that a normal sized CD/DVD drive would fit into).  It can control up to 5 fans and it'll vary speed and in the case of my fans brightness of the LEDs.
When the fans (5 of them) are full blast, it can get pretty loud. i usually don't turn them up to full blast unless doing something strenuous to my computer like playing games doing some data analysis of huge data sets.
overall good and worth the investment for a more customized computer. probably not very useful if you have 1 fan."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"I wanted to give this 5 stars but ran into a case where I wasn't even able to get these working. Here's the situation:

These where to be installed at the top and bottom of a flight of stairs. The top switch shared a junction box with another 45609 switch which controlled a different circuit.

I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.

I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.

Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.

So please be aware that there are some fringe cases where these switches aren't going to work."

I usually don't like to use snap-in cases because ones I've had in the past don't hold my iPad securely in the case ... corners are always snapping out randomly which makes me feel like the iPad itself could just fall out ... but this one seems very secure and well-made, and I haven't had any problems with the corners popping out yet. And the design is beautiful, just as vivid as the photo in the ad. Especially for the price, this is a great deal. I deducted one star because the case seems a bit heavier than I expected, but overall, I highly recommend it."
Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I definitely had a love, hate relationship with this  book. When I began to read  the book I wasn't very impressed at all. I couldn't really figure out who was who and what the story was really about. So I decided that I needed to continue on in order  to give a fair review. I'm so glad I did. The author has written a very intricate mystery that  kept me guessing throughout the book. The action is explosive and at times very intense.

Jake is a former Marine who has  a keen sense of awareness of his surroundings. I thought his  character was good and had lots of depth. He is smart, decisive, alert and had great instincts. He has a new job as a photojournalist. While following someone he inadvertently stumbles upon an assassin  at large. The assassin does  not like lawyers .  Jake seems to get one step ahead and then takes two steps back in this lively story. Who is the assassin? Why are lawyers being targeted?

I thought the assassin  was a brilliant character because he was so unpredictable. He reminds me of a ticking time bomb. You never know when it will go off but you know when it does , chaos follows. I liked the multidimensional, quirky and very unnerving characteristics he had. What I really like was how the assassin even controlled the people who hired him. With cutting words he was in control and calculated his every move. He does some very ingenious things to divert the attention away from him and on to Jake. Will Jake be able to prove who the assassin is? I recommend this book to mystery lovers who like intrigue and characters that jump off the pages with intensity.

I received a copy of this book from Beck Valley Book Tour. The review is my own opinion."

Books_5,1.0,OR,"The story was absoulutly horrible and on a rating from one to ten, it would be a negative five.  It would not be worth a cent, to even a book deprived orphan.
  For starters, it has no plot, whatsoever.  The closet thing to a plot that can be found, if you have the time and patience to look, it that, if your a mermaid, don't be annoying.
  For the mermaid in the story is beyond annoying.  She gets to the point that you just want to wring her scaly neck.  She talks back, is stubburn and rude.  And yet the two main characters in the story LIKE her!
  The story starts with these two incredibally boring girls who (fortunatly) are moving away from each other, soo.  I don't know if I could stand another sentance of ""I'll miss her so much"" or ""I wish I could go back in time.""  They the spoiled mermaid and set her up with this nice guy, who, incrediable, likes her.  It would be more likly that he would be struck by lightning, than to the find and like this mermaid.
  But all bad things can't last for forever, much to my pleasure, and the mermaid goes back to the sea, before dieing from lack of salt (booo!!!).  Then, in the end, the guy must turn into a fish, or something, because he goes out to live witht he mermaid.  They should have just had the mermaid into a fish fillet.
  If I could go back in time, I would have never read the book.  Sitting in school would have been better than reading that book."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"I went and saw this in theaters and then bought the DVD and i have to say it is a awesome movie full of action and suspenseful moments. Then lets not forget Paula Patton in a dress that will make the eyes on any guy widen while he utters the word WOW! I still nearly drool at that point in the movie. MI Ghost Protocol is by a long shot the best of the series so far. The mix of suspense, thrill, action and stunts will leave even your most demanding action junkie pleased. This is not a film that will leave much of a long standing mental impression on you, which means you won't walk out of it with a changed view on life. Then again not many action movies will change your view on life. It won't make you do much thinking like other fairly recent films like Inception but then if you use Inception as your baseline for what you like then you will find yourself displeased with movies quite often. Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is still a awesome movie that has a good plot for a action movie, good action/stunts, and the action was really good. The plot is simple like many action movies but the on-screen things like action and dialog make up for it. Then the car  with a Heads Up Display is in one word is awesome...

4/5 Stars Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol is a great movie and i recommend it to anyone who likes action movies."
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"The stated dimensions on the description are overstated in the usable space of the bag. I find the outside of the bag alone are 7.5 x 6.75 x 3. That being said the bag is still large enough for most anything you need in a hurry. Definitely enough for a very comprehensive first aid kit. I use mine for a possible bag instead. It has metal D rings attached to the back that hold a shoulder strap and enough organization room inside for all your essentials. There is enough webbing on the outside to mount any extra things you might need. Mine holds an extra knife and tomahawk. I have the platform mounted to my hunting ruck or go pack then I just peel the bag off, deploy the shoulder strap, and I am off. The zippers are nice mid duty and covered. Covered enough to ward off dust and debris and light water. Dont get me wrong it is nowhere near waterproof but the covering adds some resistance. The mounting platform comes with retaining straps to secure the bag from accidental loss if the Velcro should fail. All the webbing on the inside of the bag is elastic minus the retaining strap for the pockets allowing you to secure your load without having it rattle around. Overall very nice bag.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"I just received this book 10 minutes ago so I am unable to comment on how thoroughly it covers the basics. It appears to have a lot of detail on how to use the program.

However, be warned it is only a ""user"" guide, it has absolutely no ""tech"" info such as information on how to install or upgrade. If you have a previous version of Quickbooks and want to know any gotcha's about what happens to your data while upgrading (or how to get your data migrated into the new version) this is not the guide. If you are concerned about advanced topics such as 64-bit systems or server-based versus desktop-based or how to lock it down so everyone in the company doesn't have to be a super-user just to use the software this type of information does not appear to be in this book. There is some coverage on managing users in chapter 26 but little on how to make multi-user work so more than one person can use the software at a time and what the issues/limitations are,

In summary - if you have already got your computer guy/gal to install and set it up for you, this looks to be the right book for you. If you have an unopened box or are trying to understand what the install instructions mean, it is not and you will need additional info."

I love a good mystery with a great twist.  I love the way the story unfolds and the twists and turns that happen with each new twist.  The story was all about the very beginning of the book.  I enjoyed the fact that the author does a great job of pulling the reader in and showing us the world we live in.  The characters are all very well developed and believable.  I found myself rooting for the main character.  It was a great read.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Let me be blunt--Kowalski and Queenie were the only reason this movie gets four stars. Had it not been for their appeal as individuals and their chemistry as a couple...ish duo, I'd be giving this a three, instead. Sure, Eddie Redmayne was engaging, and Katherine Waterston was satisfactory. But the real magic--pardon the pun--rested with the performances by Alison Sudol and Dan Fogler. These two absolutely made the movie. Fogler was endearing and funny. Sudol was nuanced and magnetic. The final scene between these two--no spoilers--was my favorite part of this whole film.

And therein, I think, lies something of a problem.

Because this was supposed to be a movie about Newt. Newt and his beasts. Newt, and his beasts, and his friends. All of them fighting some dark force, as it so often goes in the wizarding world. And while this movie undoubtedly contained every one of those elements...I didn't care, At least, not as much as I expected to care with a film set in the Harry Potter Universe. Newt felt like an afterthought forced into a starring role. His animals played a very limited role in the climax of the story, despite being the stars of the title. And whole plotline surrounding the darkness they found themselves up against struck me as needlessly convoluted. In the end, I viewed this as less of a harrowing adventure film detailing the rise of Newt Scamander than a platform for enjoying the chemistry between a muggle named Kowalski and a witch named Queenie.

All in all, this film felt a little forced, largely unfocused, and--had it not been for the supporting cast--maybe unforgettable. But luckily, it has Kowalski and Queenie. So if you've got the money to spare, give it a shot for them. Or just Redbox it."

The picture shows the shirt being slim through the body but once i put it on there was lots of sleeve room and I had to bunch up, or fold over, the back of the shirt to make it look like the picture. The collar has some smaller, plastic- diamond studs to hold the collar down and the buttons are nice. I like the color of the shirt and the material was somewhat papery but I'm sure with a wash or two it would have been a softer material.

Nick is hurt to be rejected by his mate, especially after such a wonderful encounter with him. He decides to leave and honor his wishes even though it nearly kills him to do so. All he has ever wanted was to find someone to love and be loved by.

Thayne had learned at a young age that having a mate can be a devastating experience if something happens to them. He and a friend make a pact that they will never have a mate - so this will never be pain they will suffer from. Now that he has found his mate, he is wondering if he should re-think this decision. If he changed his mind, could he handle the pain if loss came?

Nick is already feeling the loss of his mate, since he was rejected by his. Then a problem arises and Nick mating with Thayne is the only solution that can be seen. Can Nick do something so selfless knowing he is not loved or wanted?

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"The problem with buying a dress shirt, is that they are cut to fit 95% of the guys out there. So they are boxy. However, deviate from the norm, then you'll end up with a shirt that isn't long enough (if you're tall), maybe doesn't close around the stomach (if you're chubby), or pinches around the shoulders and upper arms (if you're muscular). I have the problem of shirts too tight around my shoulders and upper arms. Also, I can't move my arms forward without restriction, because it's too tight across the back. Sometimes I move up to a 2XL, but then it's way too baggy around my stomach. I have no idea what those muscleheads do who are jacked up on gear, but just being thick and solid, causes me problems enough. Since my thighs are pretty strong, I have problems with pants that I can sit down in too. That's when I discovered spandex woven into the cloth. If you're bulked up from the gym, its the only option you have, unless you want to buy clothes way oversized, and wear a belt. This shirt fits me well. It isn't tight around my arms and shoulders, since the cloth has give, when I move my arms. The waist doesn't billow over my waist either. I have long arms, but it fits well with arm length. The fabric has give, but it's not elastic the way socks are for example. Also you can forget to hang this shirt on a hanger, and still be able to wear it the next day without ironing. (It smooths out, when you have it on.) I like the blue graph paper design. Best of all, I'm not pinched around my chest and back either. Wearing a shirt that doesn't fit well, because I have to buy up a size might not bother me personally. However, a shirt like this is more form fitting, so I look a little neater. I hear neatness counts."

It comes with enough pieces that two children can have fun with without actually fighting over them, but you know kids, they still might. The pieces are very sturdy and what I've come to expect from Melissa & Doug products.

The highlight of the set is definitely the timer which actually works and my little one has been having fun ""making dishes"" while using the timer, the way we do in our own kitchen. The salt and pepper shaker actually shakes so she pretends to put them on her food as well. They are all perfectly sized for small hands and with no small pieces, it would be great for kids as young as two.

You can read from the description what comes in the set so I'm not going to bore you with that, but what I can say is this is a must buy.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I really can't suggest anything that would make this film better.  The acting is top notch, not just from DeNiro and Grodin, but from the entire cast.  Each character is well defined and believable. I especially liked Dennis Farina's parody of the tough-talking Mafia boss (""Shut up or I'll shove this pencil through your heart!""), and his two flunkies (Moron #1 and Moron #2). The dialogue is great, and the film is laced with humor--the best kind of humor, situational.  There is even a tender awkward moment (when Jack, DeNiro, visits his daughter whom he hasn't seen in years, and she offers to give him her babysitting money, which he feels he shouldn't take, although he needs it).  The action is non-stop, and if you have to suspend your disbelief at times, it is a small price to pay.

The evolution of the relationship between DeNiro and Grodin's characters, as has been mentioned, is the core of this picture. It is done magnificently and is the reason the film is so great. There are so many great scenes: when DeNiro and Grodin are eating dinner on the train, when they pretend to be from the Treasury Department in order to relieve a bartender of his ""counterfeit"" 20 dollar bills, the scene in the diner when Grodin, really hungry and broke, asks what's the special today, and the waitress says chorizo and eggs (dig the look on Grodin's face). DeNiro says they can't afford it, and Grodin counters ""How about your cigarettes?"", and DeNiro says, ""I need these.""  The film is chock full of these delicious scenes--I really can't think of a dull one.

This film is forever.  Buy it and see for yourself."

The circular contrast of fibers with the light channeling is what makes it pop. I shoot clays and have a few different brands and this bead would look nice on any of them. As other reviewers have stated, don't expect this thing to be gigantic. It seems compact because of the nested fiber colors, where a solid bead would take up the whole space. The odd thing to me was that the bottom is not completely flat. It has a small raised area near the screw post, maybe to keep it from rubbing off a finish? This will not hold on its own and does need some sort of adherent (loctite, etc.) As you can find on handgun forums, this is a great front sight post replacement for handguns too.

The only criticism I have is over the daughter, Letty who is said to be 14 years in this book (but was 15 in Invisible Prey? Hmm...children do not grow younger as time passes). I found her to be WAY too mature for her age and I'm really hoping that Sandford doesn't consider her a lead character in future books. I did like the references and appearances of past characters like Del and Virgil (can't wait for a new Virgil Flowers book!). The dialog and banter was fun. I recommend this book. Sandford is one of the best writers out there. Good to see Davenport hasn't lost his edge."

The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've used this for years on my front lights to welcome us home. In the driveway an infrared type light makes sense, but on the front lights using this timer in the automated setting is best.

Installation:
I fist use a contactless voltmeter to find the Hot Wire (has 120v current)  hooked up to the light switch and mark it with nail polish. Then go turn off your circuit breaker. Next go an connect the BLACK wire to the one which you just marked with nail polish. You will need to find your neutral, which is generally white and NOT connected to a standard two pole light switch. Just find the neutral and some white 14 gauge solid white wire and create a pig tail; then connect it to the white wire with an electric wing nut. Lastly, connect the blue LOAD wire to the wire which was connected to your switch. Sometimes you might have a green wire which was a ground wire. I just loop it around the screw as I reinstall all the wires. I also tend to wrap everything in electric tape as I go to ensure no shorts anywhere.

Go to google maps and get your current location, you will need the first two numbers of your Lattitude and Longitude.  Press the big frond button for 3 seconds to enter configuration mode and follow the single directions. It's mostly updating the year, month and day, next the time and lastly the latitude and longitude. Lastly I don't like the back light on all the time, so I turn that off. It still glows for 8 seconds whenever you press any button. I use the defaul P01 which turn on at sunrise and off at 11pm in your time zone and automatically adjusts for day light savings time.

This is a very well made unit. I've noticed they've been increasing in price but purchased an Amazon Warehouse deal which was perfect, never used but just broken packaging. It saved me a few bucks and worked perfectly."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I received ""Whither Thou Goest, I will Go"" by Naomi Dathan for free from [...]  I picked this book for one reason:  some of it takes place in Kansas.  Since I am from Kansas, I usually read books with Kansas as the location since most authors do not find Kansas interesting enough to write about.  This is an incredibly good book.  I loved this.  It starts in St. Paul shortly after the Civil War with Seth, an army officer, and Jem, a spoiled daddy's girl.  Daddy calls all the shots in this marriage, including how to raise Charley, Jem and Seth's son.  He bought their house, gives Jem an allowance, hires their help, everything.  When her father gets caught with his hands in the Army's cookie jar, Seth and Jem must sell the house and move.  Seth decides they are going to Kansas.  He actually winds up in Nebraska because the house is across the state line.  They move and start a new life.  One that Seth thinks he will control and start to call the shots.  God has other plans.

Jem is a wonderful fictional character.  She is soooo dramatic and funny.  She cracks me up even when she is being horrible.  Against her will, she toughens up and matures into a valuable woman.  Her character alone is reason enough to hope for this book to be a series. The end will stun you.  The only thing I did not like was the format.  I hadn't read carefully enough to see that the format was for an i-pad.  I have a kindle.  I do have an android so I could read it that way and also online through [...]  The author sets up an account for you all you need to do is supply a password and read.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I have read several of the stories in this series and this one is probably the most hilarious. In this series men can get pregnant. It's actually the way they know that the other man is their true mate. And all have to get over some obstacles to reach their HEA.

Bobby decides that he has to get away from his family. After having seen his brother be awfully abused by their own father and knowing that his fate would be similar when his true nature was revealed, he knows he must seek out. Stupidly enough he starts his get away journey on a very cold night. Poorly dressed he is fortunate to meet Nick and his two friends who are driving aimlessly around. They deliver him at the ranch where his brother Isaac is living with his mate.
Bobby meets his own mate there, but he does not want to give in, not to begin with anyway. It takes some effort from Shott and help from among others Shott's grandfather before the stubborn Bobby realizes where his future lies.

There are some quite distinct hints as to who Nick actually is and some magic wielded to underline that. There is a mentioning of a crossroad demon. And the solution as to who had sent the killer after Bobby is not easy to accept.

I have the feeling this might be last book of this series, but there is always Mason who still is without a mate."

Books_5,4.0,OR,"I've read two of Homes' books before and loved both of them.  When I read the awful reviews on Amazon, I debated whether to read it or not.  In general, I won't read a book unless it's rated 4 stars and above.  I really enjoyed this book.  The only reason that I don't give it 5 stars is that I realize that this is not a book for many people.  I enjoyed Harold's ride of life through the book.  I thought he became a pretty good person despite his background and the bad things that happen to him in the book. I think his sex life is totally unbelievable but since I thought this book was filled with comedy, I took the sex sequences as part of the comedy.  I enjoyed the Nixon side of the book because I was around during his presidency and the mess he made of it.  I liked how Harold's life just grew around him, almost without him trying, because he was basically a nice guy.  Most families have some type of dysfunction in them and Harold's family has plenty.  However, who would not care for a sick brother or sick mother?  Who would not care for the other characters that come into Harold's life.  I think Homes has a good insight into our lives and it shows in this good book."

I have to say that I like the color and the feel of the re-branded ones, but they are not as sharp as the originals. I would have to give these a 5 star if I could.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a beautifully-written book by a highly literate author who has a respect for the written word. No gimmicks, no hype, nothing that's cheap about the all-important subject of coming of age...how refreshing! Reading the chapter titles alone is stimulating, because you get a glimpse of the structure of the book without being told the exact details (which of course, entices you to want to see how the story plays outs).

The realism of the book draws the reader in effortlessly. The journey is epic and dramatic without being formulaic or repetitious. There are many poignant lines throughout the content too, which give the book added depth and insight. I think the following line (from one of the chapters in The Same Moon) describes the book very well: ""Life was no film set, and there was no script."" I particularly enjoyed Chapter Five: The Courtship for its unabashed view on ""the dating game.""

As someone who enjoys culture and travelling, this book was certainly a treat. The strength of books like these is that they remind discerning readers how literature is differentiated from the film medium. While the latter tends to be more impressive in terms of 'visuals', good literature is intimate because it engages the reader through a one-on-one experience. That is one of the things I enjoy the most about reading, which The Same Moon delivers."

It looks like a real fire truck in action but in a toy version, very cool. When you turn it on, it lights up and makes noises and then starts going around the room, moving when it bumps into things, and then after a few seconds, it stops and lifts up and just starts spinning while raising the ladder on its own. I have had some problems with my trucks that we've gotten that are like this where they just don't last after a couple times but this one is holding up great and just seems to be built better."

After about a year of use with the bulb I decided to give it a try. It is so bright that I am not using it in the dark, so it is not that bright. I have been using it in a dark room for about a year now. The light is so strong that it is blinding the most sensitive of the eye. It is bright enough to see in a dark room, but not so bright that it causes vision problems. It is very easy to adjust the brightness of the light. The light is very bright, which is why I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a dimmed light. I put it in a dimmed light and put it in a bright light. It does not interfere with the light setting I put it in. It has a good light, but it is not as bright as a dim"

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For this to be a short I am blown away. I would have never expected the story that was presented. Although this book can be read as a stand alone  I think it is better to read the series in order so you get a better understanding of Thorn. Some secrets would be ruined but nothing ground breaking of you don't though.

As for the story in itself. I would have never expected Thorn's past, aside from what we know, to be this. It's exciting, chilling, crazy and on some level could be a true story. Although I am happy with the ending even with all it's twist and turns the ending between Simone and Thorn is a little rushed. I bet we will hear more from them though as Kiki's story is next."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such."

Flick the switch on his tusch, squeeze his left foot and Elmo reads you a Cute Little Poem, one of 5. ""Do you want Elmo to read you ANOTHER poem?"" he then says -- Well, It took us a while to realize that Shouting ""YES!!! "" was not the way to hear another poem (LOL) but SQUEEZING his left foot IS the way to entice him to recite them, one at a (foot squeeze) time. His diction is FLAWLESS. He also makes cute and pertinent comments about each poem, which is delightful to adult and child. Kids can recite the poem(s) with him. (if you don't want to hear another poem Elmo apologetically says ""OK Maybe Later, Bye Bye!""

The book he is holding has drawings on it that illustrate the poems -- ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", ""Humpty Dumpty"", ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"". ""The Itsy Bitsy Spider"", and Hickory Dickory Dock"". All of this is CUUUTE. So is Nursery Rhyme Elmo. Cute, with floppy little fuzzy legs, but not totally cuddly as his inner workings and his mouth are made of Hard Stuff and he has a hard butt -- so, carrying him around would be fun for a kid, but I doubt close-cuddling would be very enticing.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,1.0,OR,"I can only blame myself for not looking through the negative reviews on this bra. Everything that people said is true.
The bra is cheap looking from thin cotton fabric. Really not intended for sizes bigger than C cup. Also might be uncomfortably tight for sizes over 36.  I ordered XL (I'm 38D -38DD) and this is definitely way too small. It's also uncomfortable tight around my chest so no way I can wear it at night.
For the poor quality it's clearly overpriced as well. I feel fooled by trusting Medela brand to have some understanding of a breastfeeding woman's anatomy.
The return policy is not mentioned anywhere and I made another mistake trusting that it would be something similar to amazon's - i.e, free return on clothing that is in unused condition. Well, silly of me. There is a 20% re-stocking fee, plus you have to pay shipping costs. Together this will come for me to about 7-8$ at least, half of the bra's price.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"I found this movie reflected an accurate portrait of the reality of romance in a time of that war and what happened both at the front and at home. The letters we have between great grandparents courting during that time are respectful while the unwritten was the fear and longing, memories of a stolen moment kept close by both to keep the faith. The movie represented many such postal relationships that expressed love and hope while in a war that promised neither. It's that lifeline that matters in every conflict and keeps us human in an inhumane situation.

Perfect acting and direction, along with the attention to detail, made a beautiful movie."

The author doesn't insert extra words that do nothing to move the story forward and I appreciated his lean style.  At times, it seemed like there were two different writing styles and both engaged and held me.  Really interesting.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"The title gives you the short version, now here comes the longer one.  I'm reading Ms. Scottoline's works in order, so this is number 5.  In Rough Justice, she reprises Mary DiNunzio's character from book 1 and if my notes are right, (Ms.) Bennie Rosata's from book 3 -- which is nice because we're really getting inside these character's personalities which adds to the fun.  The basic premise this time is that a guest hot-shot lawyer from out of town, Marta Richter, has just heard from her client, who, thanks to Marta's hard work, is heading toward a self-defense acquittal for killing an alleged carjacker, a confession that it was murder after all.  She immediately spends the rest of the book trying to get back at him (not too sure about the ""legality"" of that), with help from Bennie's associates Mary and Judy.  The plot is actually quite good, with a lot of twists and turns, culminating in a very good ending that had me turning pages late into the night.  A number of additional corpses prevent this from being all sweetness and light, yet I think the outcome seemed fitting.  My only gripe was that 2/3 of the book took place during such a bitter and deep snowstorm that roads were closed and cities crippled.  Yet Marta manages to drive back and forth from Philly to the Jersey shore (!), with all kinds of shenanigans there, while the troops back at the law firm are out all night pulling the same stunts, even interviewing people at 2 o'clock in the morning!
Anyhow, ""Rough"" is a welcome addition to the growing Scottoline repertoire; I'll certainly be back for more, and I can overlook a little bit of unlikely traipsing around by the women for a story this entertaining!  Try it."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Reading through the different reviews here, you'd think this guy were Isaac Newton, Leonardo da Vinci and Wolfgang Mozart rolled into one.  Let me think of the simplest way to say this:  he's not.
The storyline was original, that's for sure.  And his emotion is raw.  He definitely has his finger on the pulse of something - although what exactly that is (misdirected youth?  the refusal to accept that people usually _earn_ money?) is sometimes muddled.
But the delivery is poor.  I found it cutesy and contrived.  He relies on the same old gag structure again and again - that one line delivered at the very end to set the last three pages' worth of diatribe on its ear:  ""You just missed your exit"".  ""The wallet was there the whole time.""  and so on.  Add that to the fact that the timeline was impossible to follow, and that the technique of alternating paragraphs between two different time periods does not a gifted writer make, and this presentation had serious flaws.
Unrestrained by literary devices such as plot, he goes on to present a convoluted ""three years [I think it was three years although time flow was truly warped] in the life of"" stream-or-consciousness (whoops I meant ""stream OF consciousness"") story of his recent life.
What's he getting at?  Is he misdirected?  Uninspired?  Lazy?  All of the above?  Am I supposed to admire this?  Is this the role-model of the 21st century?  For the story to be potent, I think it needed a sharper edge."

You pretty much need to assemble everything which is a pain. I'd say it would be a good exercise for a kid but my 12 year old couldn't assemble it on her own. I probably spent 45min assembling it. Alot of the pieces didn't properly snap on and i have no doubt it will pop off with continual play. The door is horrendous, it easily open ands doesnt stay closed. The background of the house inside is just a cardboard you slot in. The finished product is a good size; not too big or too small.

They included like 50 small stickers and my daughter loves stickers though so she did have alot of fun sticking them on the house and customizing it.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Short, Sexy and Steamy&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K&iexcl;K.  MY THREE FAVORITE COLORS!

Sean Whitcomb is up for a promotion at his law firm, the test is a dinner for the bosses with his partner to prove his family values. Sean could burn water, but his ex lover Isaiah is a world class chef, so he calls in a favor. Isaiah Waterston has never gotten over the betrayal he felt when Sean left him to pursue his career ten years ago. So when Sean asks him to pretend to be his lover for the weekend and cook a meal for the bosses, Isaiah is hesitant. He makes an assanine comment about topping Sean in exchange for his help, and immediately regrets it when Sean agrees.

Dinner is a huge success as is dessert which consist of Sean laid out naked on the dining room table for Isaiah&iexcl;s tasty treat. The two spend a whirlwind, sex filled weekend together and Sean is more than eager to make his pasts mistakes right. But Isaiah is not buying it and leaves while Sean sleeps and to add salt to the wound, he doesn&iexcl;t return his texts or calls. Can Sean convince Isaiah that he still loves him, he&iexcl;s changed and he&iexcl;d give up everything he&iexcl;s worked ten years to build for another chance with him? Or was one last hoorah all Isaiah was in this for?

I have a new found fascination with interracial M/M novels and novellas, and Dessert did not disappoint! A fast, fun read with some jaw dropping sticky sex on the table that involves bananas and ice cream. The story centers around the present situation with Sean trying to get his lover back, attempting to make up for past mistakes. But there&iexcl;s enough of the past and their individual current lives sprinkled in to add a little depth to the story. If you&iexcl;re looking for a quick read that ends with a cold shower, this is the book for you!

Obviously, renting a camcorder and tripod from the local camera store does NOT qualify you as the next Spike Lee. If this is the best you can do, you're not even the next Matty Rich!
How bad is this movie? Take the ""skeletons in the closet"" rant from ""Eddie Murphy: Raw"" and multiply it by 1,000! Every woman these guys know is a ""farm tool,"" ""witch with a B in front"" or worse. There's not one redeeming female character. There's not even one redeeming MALE character!

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"This wedding ring set arrived very quickly.  It really is a very nice set at a very reasonable cost.  It arrived in a very beautiful black velvet ring box.  I would not plan to wear this as an everyday ring set, since it is not a full white gold, just white gold plated, I would not expect it to hold up as well.  I like to wear different rings for different occasions, especially when traveling, so I don't have to worry about losing my actual ring set or having it stolen.

This set is very dainty looking and quite nice.  I ordered a size 7, which is what my original set is, and it fits perfectly. It's very comfortable to wear.  I take it off to wash my hands and I wouldn't sleep in it, so I have not seen any discoloration on the metal or on my hands.  For the price that this is offered at, I would definitely recommend it for someone to purchase as an extra set to wear on occasion.

Like most online shoppers, I read through reviews posted by others to determine whether I want to try out a product. I always do what I can to help by describing my purchases honestly. If I have been helpful please check yes, that it was helpful to you and I will do the same for all of the helpful reviews I find! Thank you for reading."

Update 6/7/2017, I was putting on a new reel that is balanced to this weight rod and the but cap came unglued. I have reglued the butcap and I hope this works.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"It had been decades since I first read the book, when I was prompted to read it by seeing the film with Gene Tierney. Re-reading it was interesting. I felt some of the language was a little stilted, but that's understandable because of the era in which it was written. It was even more interesting to read that Caspary was not happy with some of the choices Hollywood made when adapting the book for the screen. It's a good story and well told."

I purchased this for my dog and it's great for him to go outside in the wild and not have to worry about his ears being damaged or getting sprayed. I used it for two years and it has held up very well. I highly recommend this product. my puppy loves these. They last about a month. When he gets old and starts having problems, they'll be a challenge to chew. I've tried different ones for different dogs and I don't know if these hold up.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"Nothing special here. Good inexpensive headphones that are comfortable on your
ears and head.

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight
and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with
these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

Not a bad replacement for ear-buds if you prefer a descent set of portable
headphones. On notice: a lot of ear-buds will actually reduce exterior noise better
than these cups."

I know people -- ordinary people -- who've been badly hurt and relied on a tort lawyer to seek justice.  And the lawyers delivered.  In America today, I'm concerned this book will serve as the basis for public debate over the legal system -- and that would be silly.

They even dig through their dish to look for the mystery morsels. It's definitely something other than the actual pellet food in a different shape & color. Too bad there weren't more of these in the food, as I like to give them healthy treats once in awhile.

The stores where I usually purchase this bun food have stopped carrying it, and I am very happy that I found it on Amazon! My boys are even happier than I am! Timothy pellets are the best and healthiest for them, and most of the stores carry the alfalfa pellets or some junk with the first ingredient called ""wheat midlings.""

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!"
Books_5,2.0,OR,"Perhaps it was bad luck for V. Hislop that I came to this book immediately after Michael Chabon's Telegraph Avenue - now there's someone whose characters zing off the page, from whose pen flows effortlessly great prose and who can put together a damned good story. None of  which, sadly, applies to Ms Hislop. OK, so I might have been dazzled by Telegraph Avenue, but I think that even if I'd read The Thread close on the heels of say, a thoroughgoing perusal of the phone book, the latter would shine by comparison. I think that Ms Hislop intended The Thread to be a peon to Thessaloniki which is, I'll grant her, a great little city. But it never comes to life; if there is such a thing a taxidermic prose, Ms Hislop can do it. Poor old Thessaloniki is just a one-dimensional sketch under her hand, a stage set about which she poses a cast of cliched cardboard cutouts (the Nazi's mouth is 'thin' - aren't they always? - the protagonist's bad husband is fat and smelly; the university students are all intellectual firebrands. Etc etc). There are far better books than this about this area and this period. For example, anyone who wants a great fictional account of the sack of Smyrna should read Jerusalem Poker (Edward Whittemore), or Middlesex (Jeffrey Eugenides) or Birds without Wings (Louis de Berniers) while Alan Furst's Spies of the Balkans brings pre-war and wartime Thessaloniki beautifully alive in a way that Ms Hislop could only dream about. Don't waste your time with this book. Read something good."

These bulbs are very price, which is why I gave it a 4 star rating.

One other thing, I found some cheaper bulbs that looked like the dark amber bulb but I decided to call the place to assure that they were the dark amber they had pictured.  I wanted assurances they weren't gold.  I was told that they could not guarantee anything because it depended on the manufacturer.  Sometime the bulbs they got were gold, sometimes dark amber, and they didn't know what they had in stock at that time.  Needless to say I didn't order them.

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"OK, so first of all, as a calendar: I was annoyed that the numbers were all out of order. This made things difficult to find. I was also annoyed that the pictures on the front seem to indicate what will be behind which door, but then they weren't accurate. Now, all that said, it was nice that each door had a compartment tray behind it, and that they doors had directions on the back of the paperboard for each one. Each bag was also labeled with its number, just in case things got misplaced.

Now, as a Megablok set: I have really enjoyed Mega Blok's interpretation of Star Trek and TMNT characters. This set is a bit below the standards set by those previous sets. You only get 158 pieces, which isn't a terribly good value compared to other sets. Many of the pieces here are uninspiring to say the least. A bush? A weapon holder? There are, at least, three main characters to be had, Shredder, Casey Jones, and a turtle who can be switched via headband between all four characters. But the figures themselves are a bit below the standards set by other iterations. The legs don't move as well, the hands pop out of the arms for some reason, and assembling them is rather difficult for a kid, and even for a grownup, due to the difficulty of popping ball joints into sockets.

For the money, I'd prefer to see twice as many character figures and a lot less filler. My son, turning five in a few weeks, did enjoy that he could put together the simpler items on his own. But overall I think this represents a poor value compared to the other superior Mega Bloks sets in the TMNT family, such as the Krang set or the jungle tank set. And compared to other Advent calendar sets, such as the Lego Star Wars one, this is a poor value as well, as that set has 100 more pieces and 9 minifigures compared to 3 here."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I have had a Skycaddie SG3 for over two years. This is a great golfing aid and I wouldn't play without it. I have golfed all over North America and have not yet found a course I couldn't download. The accuracy of the distances to hazards, front, midle and backs of greens is outstanding.  I am completly convinced this unti has lowered my scores by 2 or 3 strokes a round and has speeded up my rounds by at least 15 minutes. I regularly update both software and courses with no problems. The only downside I have found is that rechargeable AA bateries don't seem to last more than 1 1/2 rounds. Non rechargeable batteries seem to last two+ rounds."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt."

He had a rough time of it when his father left the family and he was raised by his mother along with one sister and the other sister went to live with his father.

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I've heard these speakers at my local computer store. These are the best sounding among all the brands offered. Klipsch didn't sound as good and Creative Labs' isn't even an option. The control center is the best design so far. The display and power button emit a cool blue light that is nice to see at night. Every component looks very sturdy. There are three possible connections - Coax, Optical, mini. You can use all for three different sources. Just press a button from the control center to indicate what source you would like to use. How good are these speakers?  I own a couple. It may not compare to my JBL HT system which are THX-certified for true home theater use, but these cost thousands. With the price you're paying for the Logitech, it's a steal. I have Harman/Kardon Sound Sticks for my Mac and these suck especially for the price. I had Sony Dream System  DAV-C990 which I returned after two weeks because the speakers are not only dull, they seriously need some equalization. Now for the cons:
1. The speaker cords are too thin and short. 2. The cord from the control center to the bass module is way too short and the manual warns against extending it. I want my bass in the corner of the room, and the control beside my PC. 3. The remote needs aesthetic improvement. These speakers have good, powerful bass right out of the box. Bass lovers will adore these for their games and music. Just reduce the bass from the control center if it annoys you. Best of all - these are THX-certified. You can't beat the price and quality. Even Apple has adapted these speakers for their upcoming G5 desktops. And if someone knows good design, these people do."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my review."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"At this time of year I read Christmas romances. Lots of them. (If I could find Kwanzaa, Hannukah, Yule, or other winter solstice holiday romances I'd read those, too. ) Because I love themes of family and redemption that are so often present in these books. It's a fairy tale, but it's a fairy tale I really enjoy. Christmas in Snowflake Canyon brings me all the things I want in a holiday romance. It's got a disabled hero who is recovering from his injuries and the war that caused them (and an excellent presentation of disability), a heroine who absolutely has to grow up and comes to realize that on her own, matchmaking, and lots and lots of family fun. I'll be looking for more by RaeAnne Thayne."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I enjoyed reading this book because it includes effective technique on how to gain self-esteem, like psychotherapy, and mindfulness-based therapy.

We should never take our self for granted. The book is well-written, concise and clear."

Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"Excellent wireless unit! Surprised at how fast the internet connection is!

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the front of the unit is a plastic ""good"" case, but it's a little difficult to open and close. I wish it had a little more padding for the corners. The only thing I wish I had known was that I could use this in a different room or on different floors. But that's not what I expected. I'm not sure if I would be able to use it in my room if I was sitting next to it. I think it would be more useful if I could just turn it on and off. I'm not sure if it would be better to just turn it on and off if I was sitting next to it. But I'll leave that for the next review. The only real downside to this unit is that the ""bad"" screen is a tad blurry, but I'm happy with the overall picture. The other screen is just a tad larger and has a slightly bigger image. I have this on my computer and it's easy to use."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"Does it's job well.
You wouldn't know it from the picture, but this thing is quite big, huge is the word. It definitely doesn't make your bike look like a sissy, but it's a little bit out there. As for the convenience of taking it off fast, that basically saves this product, I ride mostly without it, only considering it for rainy days."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,I like having a spoke wrench set of separate tools instead of one of those that has all of the sizes on a single coin-shaped tool. The Avenir set is exactly what I wanted. They're easy to use and provide sufficient leverage to work on very tight or corroded spokes.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,"I love lava lamps, but this is a terrible ""tank"" for a Betta. It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I don't much care for having a removable lens cap on a string (like my old 2000-era digicam from Sony), and I wish the zoom was a bit better, but everything else about this camera I love.

It takes the best low-light no-flash pictures of any camera I've had -- finally beating out the old F2.0 Sony camera I had back in 2000. I've looked for years to find something like this, and can finally replace my Fuji F10 (which wasn't as good, but had clean high ISO low-light performance).

And altough I thought I'd hate it, I ended up LOVING the pop up flash -- so convenient compared to toggling computer menu options.

Pet_Supplies_5,1.0,OR,I decided to purchase a newer canister type filter.  The reason for this is my 54 gallon tank had been shut down for 3 months with only the dried up gravel in it.  So I started it back up in October of 2014 with my Magnum 350.  I decided to test my tank for ph and ammonia levels and found out that the ammonia was 1.0 ppm too high.  Of course I immediately dosed the tank with Ammo Lock.  Other then that the tank was doing well with no fish in it as of yet.  Because of the ammonia I went to my local pet store supplier and purchase the Aqua top CF400UV.  Installed it and within 24 hours the tank started to cloud up.  I made several water changes and cleaned the filter several times over a period of 2 weeks to no avail.  I contacted my local supplier and they replaced it thinking it must have been defective.  Well! The tank never cleared even after another 10 days of water changes and filter changes.  So I thought I would reinstall my Magnum 350.  Within 12 hours my tank was nearly clear.  After 24 hours it was crystal clear.  So I guess I have to say that I either got two defective filters or the Aqua top 400 UV just could not handle my water condition.  I have over 30 years experience with fish and tanks and I am baffled by this.  I found the filter easy to use and to be very quiet.  Just as an FYI for others who are new to this non self priming filter.  You should fill the canister first about 1 from the top and install the cover then fill the in and out inlets.  Hook it up and just press the primmer button twice or more and just turn it on and you are good to go.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"H. Paul Jeffers's biography of Grover Cleveland is readable, but I found myself thinking of the famous Walter Mondale phrase, ""Where's the Beef?""  Checking in at a brief 350 pages, made all the shorter by the interspersion of photographs throughout the text, this book is a good bare bones account of Cleveland's life in which the reader never really gets to know the man.  Cleveland is a vastly underrated President, mostly because didn't serve at a time of great national crisis.  So the recent interest in him (no less than two biographies published in 2000) is a good thing.  Jeffers's book did much to enlighten me, but left me wanting more.  I also found a couple of glaring factual errors.  Overall, Jeffers's book is a good introduction to its subject, and that's probably all most casual readers will want to know."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"These have been out of print for years and the US editions currently cost around $200. It's nice to find the imported version going for a reasonable price.

This has all of the Magnificent World 1 & 2, which is a light hearted comic anime series. It was popular enough to spawn two other series: El-Hazard The Alternative World and El-Hazard The Wanderers; but it's Magnificent World that started it all.

This version is an imported edition, so don't expect the fancy box or slip covers that came with the US version, but the content inside on the discs is the same. This is all 11 episodes from Magnificent World 1 & 2. (1 was 7, 2 was 4)"
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,CG,This book definitely elicits emotion. I love the way it is written. The characters are well-developed and the story is well-written.

These pants are very comfortable.I bought this for my son, who lives in the North Dakota area.  He is 5'3"" and 175lbs, which is perfect for him.  He wears a size 7 and it fit perfectly.  I did have to give it a star because the pockets were extremely small for my son, but I highly recommend it for any size.  It's very comfortable.  I highly recommend this for all kids.I bought these for my daughter. She loves them.These are super cute and comfortable. I have had some bad luck with some of the other reviews which I found were misleading. I got a size small and they fit perfectly. My daughter is 5'2"" and they fit her perfectly. My daughter is 5'4"" and they are about the same width as the rest of the pants. She will order a size up if she wants them to be a little longer. They are also very comfortable.I love the comfort of these shoes. They feel very comfortable, and are very comfortable. They are very easy to put on and off. I have tried several brands of shoes in different colors and colors, and I have never found any that are too comfortable.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I admit, I purchased this book based on the price and easy reading material.  I was hooked from the first chapter.  I loved the characters, understood the emotion and the description felt as though I could visualize everything they were going through.  Towards the middle-end, I was a little disappointed.  I guess it had to be done, but it just wasn't working for me.  The ending was marvelous.  I haven't read such a good book that made me feel so good in a really long time.  That's a good feeling!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,2.0,OR,"Great lights. However the 18650 batteries WILL eventually lose the ability to hold a charge. I just replaced one after 3 years. Simple Phillips head screws and I like replacing with  EBL batteries. Much better than those cheap blue ones that come with it.
Update:just ordered four more to take care of more places that get dark. 4 for me and 4 for my new neighbor that doesn't know how to use the internet (she's 81) but wanted to get lights like mine. When I told her the price she was delighted (pun intended lol)

UPDATE: I have apparently the some of the  older models (bought 2 years ago) These NEW ones don't do what the old ones did. They only have ""on"" and ""dim to bright"" modes. My old ones had THREE settings. ON...dim to bright when motion is detected AND totally off and then bright when motion is detected. In the WINTER I need the last mode. I HATE when companies ""improve"" things. Probably due to the fact that people couldn't figure out how to use a bent paper clip to change the modes."

This little mouse paired within seconds (just hold the buttons all down at once, like the description says) and was working immediately. Setting for it are accessible in the Setting menu under Language and Input. It operates smoothly, and is comfortable in the hand. It pairs immediately everytime I turn it on, and it has brought me back up to my accustomed speeds. The only complaint I have, and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is it's texture. It's contoured to be comfortable to the hand, and it is. But it's also slick all over. There's no rubberizered finish or textured band to give you hand purchase. I've dropped it many times, and foresee going through a few replacements because of it. But for the price and performance, I can live with that."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,2.0,OR,"Functional, yes. Durable? We didn't get off to a great start together, this Pescadero 20 Carry-on and me.

I opened the package to find a loose zipper pull falling out at me and I couldve just ended my review there. Based on the other reviews, Im not the only person that received a flawed item out of the box. Id be wary of it and Id be wary that the other zipper pulls won't last. My internal zipper for the liner on the side of the handle also was missing a zipper pull altogether.

In terms of actually using the Pescadero to travel, it does reasonably well and holds itself up as a four-wheel spinner should, including its telescoping handle. I took it on a car trip, which is probably as much as I care to trust it. I like that its lighter than other 20-inchers Ive used before, although you can pay a premium for lighter weight specs if you choose elsewhere.

However, for flying, I don't like that it doesnt have any other exterior access compartment, nor does it have a TSA lock and no internal pockets. For a hard-shell exterior, its less rigid compared to my current hardshell. I can push the exterior in too easily with my hand alone. I cant put my trust in it and leave a proven, durable case behind when it will inevitably get checked and beaten on by baggage handling.

If I cant trust it, it doesnt fly with me. I expected better for the price."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I needed a multi-color comforter or quilt and this looked like it would work and the reviews were good.  It is just perfect.  It had a chemical smell when I took it out of the package, but after I washed and dried it along with the shams, no more problem there.  And it washed up beautifully - no shrinkage at all. It is a very colorful and rich look for our guest bedroom. You could use just about any color of sheets with this and it will look great. I like having a quilt instead of my usual comforter sets because of the fact that it is easily washable at home - and if you have kids or pets, that is a good thing."

I would recommend it to anyone who likes to read historical fiction.This is a very good book.  The first two books in the series are the most entertaining.  The ending was very predictable.  I will read the third book in the series.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that I am a fan of the series, so I will probably read the third book in the series.  The fact that it is short is that it is a good read.This is a very good book. I like the fact"
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Thank you, Sunbeam for a great product!  It's not even technically winter yet, and we've already had bitter cold temperatures and lots of snow in northern NY.  We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!"

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Ever season of Beauty and the Beast has woven its spell around me a different way. In the first season, we learn of the development of Catherine and Vincent's relationship, as well as being introduced to the wonderful people Below. In the second season we saw the two hero's love fourish and the different trials and tribulations they had with separation issues, and Vincent's internal demons.

The third season, in my opinion, is what really shines out of the entire series. While there are only 12 episodes, the excellent writing and story arcs completely make up for it. Ron Pearman is at his best as Vincent. Really, in my opinion, his best acting the entire series. You also really get to know more about what makes people tick ""above"" and how Catherine really touched everyone she met.

You gain more respect for Eliot Burch, Cathy's on-off boyfriend from earlier times. Joe Maxwell gets a real backbone, and I kind of disliked him at times. New character Diana certainly does NOT take Catherine's place, and her and Vincen't relationship is far from being a romantic one. I have read in places that she seems to have some sort of paranormal powers, but I have not seen that in the episodes I have watched so far. She seems to have excellent insticts and investigative skills.

Now the character Gabriel, man I love to hate this guy. He's just pure evil incarnate. You can tell that Vincent's son is sensitive to him, because every time Gabriel is in the room it seems the child gets distressed.

A couple plot elements have gotten me a little confused so far, but it is negligible at this point, and I am hoping is cleared up by the time I watch the last episode."

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"ABOVE AND BEYOND is a quasi-documentary true life account of the role that Colonel Paul Tibbets played as the pilot of the B-29 Superfortress that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima in 1945.  From start to finish, the focus is squarely on the pressures placed on Tibbets (Robert Taylor) and on his wife (Eleanor Parker) who must endure many months of separation from him, all the while with her never knowing his true objective.  Taylor plays Tibbets as a basically decent sort who has to confront early on that it will be his finger that will drop a bomb killing tens of thousands of Japanese men, women, and children.  There is a key scene when Tibbets' commanding officer gives him a button to push and tells him that if he pushes it, more than one hundred thousand will perish.  Tibbets responds by pushing it.  This sets the tone of the movie.  Tibbets has to be hard on himself so that the war may end sooner.  He understands a brutal paradox of war--that for thousands of his people to live, an equal number of the enemy must die.  His wife, of course, does not have the luxury of knowing what he knows and her reaction of resentment is eminently understandable.  ABOVE AND BEYOND is not a plot driven film.  It is no more than a straightforward recording of the pressures faced by one good man who knows that some sacrifices must be made to win a war.  And this is the problem with movies like this.  Tibbets and his wife are essentially static characters with no room for growth.  Taylor shows emotion by growing surly.  His wife becomes stressed out.  Yet the war itself seems little more than a backdrop against which one family plays out a series of squabbles.  The tragedy of war films in general is that such squabbles are often an inevitable result of the much greater carnage occurring discretely offscreen."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,I sat through the entire run of Angel but this is rough going.  Maybe you have to have a Valley Girl mentality.
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"My standards for movies are relatively simple - the plot has to engage me to the end without offending my intellect or my spiritual understanding of the world, the storyline should have redemptive value, and the action and script should be believable and appropriate to the situation portrayed. This movie sits on my shelf because it fits all these categories.
It's the story of a kidnapping, but it revolves around the person left behind - and here lies it's strength. Even though I am no great fan of Meg Ryan, her intensity and anguish were believable and moving. Russell Crowe is (as usual) excellent at defining a character in thin lines of nuance while David Norse was achingly fragile and volatile.
Its rare to find a film that doesn't deserve it's R rating. I think this is one of them. The language and violence in this film are wholly appropriate to the subject matter, and thankfully, all other offensive content was cut during the editing process.

The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.  I have had no issues with it.  I love the fact that I can use the blades with a single hand.  I just have to pull the blades away from the blade, and it will eventually melt.  The blades have a nice twist-able handle.  I love that they are made of glass.  I will be purchasing more of these.  The blades are very sharp, and the blade spring is very firm.  I love that the blades are made of glass.  I like that they have a clear plastic backing.  I have also purchased the metal blades for my next blender.  I love the fact that the blades have a very soft edge.  I use these to slice a lot of vegetables and salads.  I love the fact that they are made of glass.  I love that the blades have a very soft feel to them.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  I also love the fact that they have a nice, smooth feel to them.  I am very happy with the purchase.  I highly recommend these blades.I bought this to protect my coffee cup from frosting and baking.  The cup is sturdy and a great value.  I have tried several other types of coffee makers but never had any issues with it.

I have a little smaller dog, so it was a challenge to fit him properly. The material is soft and plush, so I can't say I am impressed. It is a little heavier than I expected, but it is still a nice collar for small dogs. I will buy again.I have used this collar for my dog for about a year now, and he still has some issues.  He has had it for a couple weeks now, and it is not as strong as I had hoped.  I have been using it for about 3 months now, and he has not had any issues.  I have used it several times, and the metal is holding up.  I will purchase another collar, and I will buy the metal again.  I would definitely recommend this collar.  My dog is about 20 lbs, and he was very rough with this collar, so I would recommend it.  I was very disappointed in this collar, and I would not buy this again.  It does not hold up to a full length leash, and it does not allow you to attach it to a harness.  I have tried several different collars, and this one does not hold up"
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I wasn't expecting it to be flawless, and it has been satisfactory thus far (though I have not had it long). I will update this in a few months when I have used it more!"

Yet I fell in love with it!  It is freaking hilarious.  I love the author's humor, and I was laughing out loud over and over again.  I am so glad I wasn't reading this book in public because I would have gotten some looks.  I absolutely adored the characters - Etienne is hot and I wish he were mine, and Anna is so easy to relate to.  I don't feel like I read about these characters; I feel like I am actually friends with them.  I loved the charming Parisian setting and details; I felt like I was there in Paris.  The book is utterly believable, and it had me hooked from the first page.  I could not put it down!  I stayed up til three in the morning to finish it, and then I couldn't sleep because I kept thinking about it!  This is a magical, funny, romantic novel and I would love to give it six stars instead of five.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Never heard about this one, but ended up glued right through to its end. Great find! A dark comedy about a teenager's frustration with setting out on the road to self-discovery and coming to a dead end.

The dialogue is nimble, the music apt, and the screenplay a refreshing change from the pat assembly-line teenybop flicks cranked out several times a year by Hollywood. The plot is peripheral, it's the characters and a fluid narrative that take center-stage.

As delightfully droll but cynical 17 year-olds facing the first challenges of adulthood -- leaving home, getting a job, finding a love life -- the two female protagonists do a fabulous job of coming across as outsiders among their peers never quite trying to ""fit in"".

In what begins as a harmless goof, one of them finds herself drawn to schleppy forty-something Seymour (Buscemi), a regular Joe and collector of 78rpm records. You know Buscemi from character roles in a bunch of popular movies, including Reservoir Dogs; all pent-up cynicism and inherent geekiness, he couldn't be more perfect in this role.

Thrown in are other interesting caricatures of some pretty credible small town characters, notably an art teacher who got more inane with every highfalutin bit of art she expounded on high school kids.

Thankfully, the movie resists the temptation of convenient closures so some may take issue with how it all turns out for the teenage girl and the middle age geek. But it feels more real this way.

What a marvellously done film. Rent it pronto, even the credits are worth it."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass. My clothes dry TWICE as fast as they used to."

I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.

I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion.

Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream color, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comfortable though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

There are 4 Alpha male characters, each with their own unique personality, that I found particularly interesting. The story is told from both the POV of a female character and the POV of a male character. The alpha male is a strong, alpha man who has been given the female name after his family's death and is also a military man who has been given the male name. He has had to face his own demons and go through some difficult times, but he does not want to let his feelings for the female lead get in the way of his personal happiness. The main character, Asher, is a recovering alcoholic who is not only struggling to get back into her life but is also having a difficult time adjusting to life in the military. Asher is a good student and a good friend to Asher, who is a military man. Asher's friend, Aria, is the widow of a service member."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Wow, this is one very intense read! I was so blown away by the emotional pull in this book. I have read other books that Alice has co-authored with and have always loved her work. I have to say I think she outdid herself on this one. So many times I didn't know if I wanted to laugh, cry or just slam the book down and run. When you meet Saga she is just skimming by. Shes worried about making rent and having food to eat. Doing her best to hold on to a job that is not enough to get ahead. When she is at her lowest point, so she thinks things went south in a hurry. When there is no other option she takes a job as an escort. This is where she comes to know Jackson Stone. He is a very rich man who is looking for someone different from who is usually spent his time with. He goes to his long time friend Victoria who runs an escort service. Victoria sends Saga (Meadow) to Jackson knowing she is just what Jackson wanted except for a few overlooked details. Saga tells her self after meeting Jackson that she will not fall for the attraction she feels for Jackson. He is just a job. Jackson pushes his attraction for Saga away by telling his self that she is just a warm body to enjoy when he feels the need to. You are going to want to bash these two heads in at times. At times you're going to love Jackson how caring he is but then he turns and says or does something that you just want to slap him for. Saga is strong, but like all women she has a breaking point and Jackson seems to find just the right buttons to push to break her when he feels like she is getting too close. These two draw you in and keep you wanting more. Im looking and hoping for more from these two."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Because the author gave me a copy of her book to review, Amazon will not say verified purchase. I started off reading this novel kind of slow, as I myself am also an author. I found this book from the fourth page on to be written with charm. On every page, there is a twist and turn that seems like it would really happen in real life. One of my favorite parts of the novel is at the beginning when the protagonist met a stand in for the new contractor. He called the protagonists' house a haunted house. I could relate to growing up with houses that I thought were haunted and I remember going in them and running out because I was so scared. Eventually, everyone has to face something that they are not willing to. It'sa good read and I think anyone reading it will enjoy it."
Books_5,5.0,CG,"In another review, I rated this book 3.5 out of 5.

The premise of the story is simple enough: the most powerful man in the world, the great ruler of the world, is in the process of ascending to the throne. This man is still waiting for the sun to set. And with it, he will rise and be the one to rule the world.

This book is about the life of a strong man, the one that can conquer the world, and his father, the great king, who will be the one to rule the world.

The book starts off with a good introduction to the subject matter, but as the book progresses, you begin to get to know the main characters. I loved how the author used a lot of descriptive and narrative language to bring the story to life.

At the beginning of the book, the main character, Eileen, is a woman who has a husband and two children. She is a single mom and is in love with her husband. She is always doing something to help her children. Eileen does everything she can to help them, and it seems that she is constantly being selfish. When her husband dies, she finds a beautiful young man who is going to help her out. The story is very well written, and the characters are likable.

I really enjoyed the book. The main character, Alan, is"

I don't know why the Sabrent causes the iMac to crash, I tried it on my 2012 MacBook and it worked fine, but the combo of this hub with a USB C cable is a cleaner install and the USB C cable is cheaper than the external power supply and you get one less wall wart in your life."

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"Secret Smile.  Rate *****
A well acted and directed probably made for television as it was presented in 2 parts.  Started rather a bit slow but this Psychological thriller developed very excitingly as the time passes. Suspence prevaled as the minutes passed. I have not read the original novel by the now established Nicci French from which the script was adapted.
I don't like to get inside the mind of this psychopath whose mysteries smile was full of venom, while showing innocence.  I recommend that it. It is more than worth having this DVD in your library.
The quality of the transfer is very good as also the sound track.  It has a very exciting finale after all the jealousy, greed and revenge not to mention the innocent deaths.  Actors David Tennant (Casanova) and Kate Ashfield (Shaun of the Dead) in my opinion were great.  Don't reviel the ending."

I got 3 sizes, I figured I can try all on keep the one that fits and return the other two. The medium fits like an extra small, the large fits like a small, I kept the xL and it fits like a large. They have an elastic waistband which is wonderfully comfortable especially if you have a little extra tummy and they are high waisted which also adds to the comfort.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This thing is awesome! I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.
I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase."

INGREDIENTS: Made ingredient is BEEFHIDE vs rawhide. Rawhide is the inner layer of the hide of any cleft-hoofed bovine livestock. Beef-Hide is premium rawhide made from cows raised for consumption. So, this is just another form of rawhide that is from cows as opposed to just any animal with a cleft hoof.  The Healthy hide rawhide has some extra potato starch, salt, soybean oil, vitamin E (100 IU), and preservatives.  The Healthy Hide sticks have almost ZERO SMELL.

The Healthy hide sticks come with 20 sticks but they smell like plain old rawhide and my dog just leaves it lying around.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"This watch was a lot bigger and heavier than I'd expected. I have thin wrists. I wear Medium-sized gloves. This watch looks comical on my naked wrist and feels ungainly.

This is not a watch for everyday use. This is for sportsmen, to be strapped atop bulky clothing. The watch feels very strong and rugged, good for rough sports activity. Were I to see a man wearing this watch at a formal function, I'd think he was ""trying too hard"" to impress, wearing such a gaudy (albeit attractive) timepiece.

I've read that watches are declining in sales, because so many people now rely on their smart phones to know the time. Watches are increasingly being used as jewelry, or to make a statement. This watch is certainly eye-catching. But this watch is also useful if you're wrapped in bulky sports clothes, and don't want to fumble for the smart phone in your pocket.

Plus, this watch has a second hand. My smart phone provides no way for me to measure the passing of seconds. So this watch also serves as a stop watch.

My watch came with the WRONG MANUAL. It came in a nice box, with a nice paper manual. But the watch described in the manual is not the one that came in the box. My watch's face and features are entirely different from the diagrams of the watch in the manual. For instance, my watch only has a second hand, not the 1/10 of a second hand pictured in the manual.

It's very easy to find scrubs in stores and I have no complaints.I love these boots! I have them in a size 8, and they fit great. They are soft and comfortable.

The hero is a jerk who we are meant to dislike, but I found him even more irritating then most.  About three chapters in, I was totally bored and almost didn't finish it.

But, as a person who hates leaving a book unread, I did read it all the way through.  As I got more into the story, I become more attached to the characters as they work toward overcoming whom they were to become who they do.  I am glad I finished it.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Caveat, I love Dominion.  This is more Dominion, so I love it.  The new mechanics are fun, and give some good variability to the game. Debt is an interesting mechanic, but it ultimately is just a new and limited form of currency that only applies to 6 of the 29 kingdom cards and 1 each of the events and Landmark cards.  Otherwise it is unused throughout the entirety of Dominion except for those 8 cards (so far).

It was supposedly conceived as a sequel to Prosperity, but I have to say I would not have clued in on that without doing some reading.  There are more Victory cards sure, but the highest costing Kingdom card is 5 coins if you don't consider the few cards that cost 8 debt.  If you are the sequel to Prosperity, that introduced 5 coin Platinum treasure and 8 coin cost cards, well you see my confusion as to calling this a sequel.  It brings back the split upgrade feature of Adventures, but only on one item, the castles, which pretty much only provide victory points.  It offers 2 duration cards, SeaSide is still my favorite expansion so yay there.

Adventures was a far more extensive expansion, I understand it is bigger by design but this feels underwhelming after that one. This actually feels like an expansion to the Adventures expansion, as we get more events and the locations mechanic feels like an extension of the event mechanic.  If you love Dominion, have at, but this is probably down around Hinterlands territory for me in the order of acquisition, ie one of the last expansions someone building a dominion set should worry about buying."

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"I am an Asian and am 5""3' tall and weigh around 101 pound. I usually wear ""x-small petit"" in the US size. In trying out this cape coat, I can tell this coat is probably made based on Asian size, which means the size would be one to two sizes smaller than the US size. When I live in Taiwan, I usually wore small, and after I moved to the US, I wear x-small petite. So be aware of the size before you purchase this item. I will say go one size up if you follow the US size. For example. If you usually wear small in the US, you probably need to order a size Medium for this coat. I ordered an x-small. It fits, but the shoulder part might be a little bit tight. But I guess a small might be even better for me. The style of this cake coat is simple, cute, and elegant. It will go well with almost anything. It is light weight, and the texture is soft. It is sort of ""thin"" compared to a regular winter coat. It would be good for spring or fall l, but for winter, it will be too thin for me. The quality of the coat is ok. I won't say it is made from very good material. I can tell it might get wrinkled easily (for its thin material) if you do not fold it neatly. Overall, I like this coat. For its price, it is good enough."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Double Fudge"". . . This book once again focuses on the book's main character Farley Drexel Hatcher (B.K.A. ""Fudge""). He is absolutely hilarious in this book. His obsession with money, his twin cousins and their little brother nicknamed ""Mini"", along with their parents are another interesting twist in this story. Peter Hatcher, Fudge's  older brother, who is now an official ""junior high school student"",  typically experiences all of the anxiety that is associated with  early adolesence.
This book made me laugh and laugh, especially the reaction of Mr. Hatcher when he discovers that their his cousins  want to stay at their house longer than a week.
I was also able to put myself in  many of the situations and generally grasp a feel each of the characters.
The first book that I ever read in the Fudge series was ""Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing"" followed by ""Superfudge"". I can remember attending Jefferson Elementary School in Little Rock, Arkansas waiting in line for what seemed like an infinity, to have first bid on checking out that book. I became a ""reader beaver"" thanks to Judy Blume and the wonderful staff at Jefferson Elementary who encouraged all students to build their foundation through reading. I used to walk swifly through the library with the rest of my classmates running straight towards the ""B"" fiction section --shouting, ""Ready or not here I come.""
This is an excellent read, and it is authors like Judy Blume who grasp the interest of young readers by  making her work interesting and identifiable to young readers. Thank you Ms. Judy Blume for providing great reading material for children of all ages!"

We bought this item, thinking its extra length, coupled with the gooseneck, would potentially solve the driping water problem. The extra length gets whatever dripping 6 inches away from the control handles and tub spout! The ""Waterhill"" (goose neck) actually helps with prompt turn-off of water, and related ""after-drips"" which used to occur.

After using my pocket knife to cut a canteloupe, I decided it was time to replace a couple of ancient Henkels knives. I didn't start out looking at bargain knives; but when I spotted CUISINART on amazon.com suggestions, I jumped on these. I knew the Amazon A-Z guarantee would protect me if they were junk; only concern was maintaining the edge without grinding the finish off. To my relief, the cutting edge is exposed stainless steel that will sharpen nicely. Promptly tried the unusually serrated utility knife to cut a melon; I had never seen a blade quite like the wavey edge on the utility and bread knives - fantastic!

Toys_and_Games_5,1.0,OR,"When the MH dolls first came out I thought. ""With the way they pop on and off, why not do them all like this and make them interchangeable?""  yeah great idea right?  No, not when Mattel is being greedy. I made the mistake of buying almost everyone of these kits. God Help Me!  I got completely ripped off. They are cheap, the wigs look like crap, the arms and legs are loose, and the hip joints break with little movement. I cant believe that Mattel has gotten so cheap. I mean first the first set of MH dolls end up breaking like crazy, then this?  Come on Mattel don't you have enough money????? Do you really have to rip off us parents this close to Christmas????  This set was NOT worth the money, and I didn't pay hardly anything for it at the store. None of these sets are worth a flip. I might as well toss them ALL in the trash or had just set my dollars on fire in the store. I will be very cautious in buying ANYTHING new from Mattel that is MH. So parents just beware. If you buy any of these kits just know that you are getting half of what you pay for, if that. What is next?  A pile of crap with the MH logo on it?  Really Mattel, really?  This set is even worse than the others and I bought them all unfortunately! The wings won't stay on, none of the torsos look good with any of it. The wig is cheapy, it looks like crap. the dress looks like it is cheap and it isn't even. The velcro is off to the side and you can see it from the front. It just looks terrible. The legs and arms, like all of the others, won't stay on. So just save your money, just wait for the real doll."

I got the size large so my two 20lb dogs could share it and it seems to be enough room for the both of them. The material seems sturdy. I did notice the base was real wobbly when I was taking it to the outside but it didn't seem to be an issue when one of my dogs jumped on it but time will tell. I just made sure the bolts were tight.

It is about a good guy, but he is always doing something bad, so he is always doing it right.  It is a very good movie and I would recommend it to anyone who has a heart.  It is a good movie.  It is fun.  Great movie.  I recommend it to anyone who has a heart."

If your looking for an action packed sub story then this book won't meet your expectations. If occasional sub action filled with soap opera drama is for you then by all means read this book.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Life has not been kind to John Moon.  Depressed because his wife left him, he spends his lonely days planning a reunion that will never happen.  Living alone in a cramped, dirty trailer, he leads a hand to mouth existence.  Chronically unemployed, he has taken to poaching to put food on his table.

One morning, Moon hunts and wounds a deer.  Tracking the animal to a nearby rock quarry, he senses movement behind him.  Reacting instinctively,  he whirls and fires a single shot into the surrounding wood, and sees something brown crash to the ground.  Assuming he has downed the deer, he begins to walk towards the trees.  It is only after he is charged by the wounded deer that he realizes he must have shot something else.

When Moon investigates, he discovers the body of a young woman.  Struggling to stay calm, Moon conducts a search of  the area, and discovers the girl's belongings, along with a package containing some $80,000 in cash.  Moon, overwhelmed by events, decides to hide the body and take the cash.  Shortly thereafter, he finds himself at the center of a bizarre series of events, as the money's owners eventually trace it back to him.  Moon, unable to contact the authorities, becomes involved in a life or death game of cat and mouse with ruthless criminals who have only one goal--to get their money back at all costs.

A Single Shot is a convincing portrait of a simple man caught up in circumstances beyond his control.  Moon's anxiety and despair is palpable, and the sense of menace Jones creates is almost overwhelming at times.  Grim and macabre, this gripping saga of small town mayhem and madness will shock and disturb you.  Reminiscent of the work of Jack Ketchum and James Dickey,  A Single Shot really hits the mark."

I was a little disappointed that the movie was not made by the makers of the movie, as they had no interest in making a sequel to a classic movie. This is a classic movie, with great story, great cast, and wonderful scenery. The ending was a little disappointing, but it was just what I expected. I am not sure if I will watch the movie again, but it is worth seeing. If you like classic movies, this is a great movie. You will be enjoying it. This is one of those movies you can watch over and over again. I would recommend this movie to any movie lover. Great movie for a good price."

This book really sparked my interest in the current prospects that there may be much more to be found within King Tut's tomb that might relate to Nefertiti.

I had seen movies like ""A Thief in the Night,"" and those that followed it, but had never seen one of this caliber before. The acting was Hollywood-esque, the storyline captivating, and overall production was top notch. Additionally, if I had not already been a Christian, this would've pushed me over the edge into becoming one. The movie focuses on what would happen if Jesus came back to receive his church on a Sunday morning, and involves several people that you figured would've known better to make sure that they were ready. If you like end-of-the-world drama that is subtle, yet substantial, this one is for you!!"

I will probably just get a new one, as it is nice to be able to hold it for longer than it is in my hand. The only thing I really like is that it has a small pocket on the back, and that it is really easy to find it when not in use. I think I'll just buy another one.

This duffle bag comes packaged to look just like a laptop sleeve--it folds up that concisely.  It packs away like an over-sized notebook, and I can slip it in just about anywhere without seeming to add any bulk at all.

It is very nice looking, made of tough nylon material.  Stitching is tight and straight.  Zippers are quality and zipper tabs are large enough to grab easily.  It is not a smooth, effortless motion to maneuver the zipper tab around the corners, but it does get around the 90 degree corners without coming out of the track.  There are extra pockets, too, and decent handles.

I really enjoyed the story, and I found it to be a fun read.  It's a bit of a letdown in my opinion.  I think it's a good story, but I think it's not the best book I've read in a long time.  I think the writing was just too choppy"
Electronics_5,2.0,OR,"I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,CG,"Both of these whisks are very accurate and the finish is good. The only reason I gave it four stars is that the plastic parts are very small, and the cover is very flimsy. I would not recommend this product to anyone. This is a very good product. I love it. I love the color, the size, the quality. It has great storage for my bags, and I love the fact that it is easy to clean. I have not used it yet, but I am sure I will. I'm very happy with it. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This movie reminded me of several episodes I saw on Law and Order and Special Victims regarding children sociopaths. It wasn't difficult to see that Kevin had a serious behavioural problem early on, as a viewer it was quite clear.  However, as a parent it would be very difficult to admit your child had little or no conscience  at all and was capable of committing such heinous acts.  My heart went out to Tilda Swinton for trying to deal with a child she realized had serious problems, with no one to turn to for help or guidance, it was quite hopeless.  I got the feeling from the start of her pregnancy and after the birth she never seemed happy about motherhood.  The question presents itself. Are the mother's feelings transferred to the child during pregnancy?  I recommend this movie to those who like realistic but difficult subject matter."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,"I received this as a gift. The quality is good and it fits my son's bike perfectly. I bought this for a friend, and he is a big fan. He likes it so much that he bought it for his next camping trip. He is very happy with it. He also likes it. He's also going to use it for a lot of other things. I'm sure he will love it! I highly recommend it to anyone who needs one. This is a great tool for camping or backpacking. The mount is very secure, and it is well built. This tool is super lightweight and lightweight. I have used it a couple of times in the field and it is very easy to use and to assemble. It does work well for the purpose it is intended for, but for the price, I would definitely recommend it.

I have learnt to believe in myself. I have a job and I love it. I have hope and dreams. I have learnt to have a vision for my self and I have learnt to have faith in myself. That is what Joel Osteen's book is all about. He talks about enlarging our vision for our lives, letting go of the past, choosing to be happy, live to give and so on. This book is for people who are down in the dumps, for people who have been beaten in life. Yes there is no mention of God's love and redemption except for the last page.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"""No middle ground here: you'll find a whole bunch of other people who are also just as religious as you.  The whole film is a bit too long, and the dialogue is very contrived.  I found myself in a very uncomfortable place.  This movie is a far cry from the original.  And I love the fact that the writers have made it so simple to follow the traditional religious themes.  And I love the fact that they have some very interesting ideas in this movie.  But I felt that the script was too simple.  They tried to make the movie so simple and boring, and the movie is just so boring.  But they could have made it so much better.  So I was disappointed.  I loved the movie.  It's a bit cheesy and a bit dull.  It's very boring.  I'd watch it again.  I don't really like the plot.  It's just a tad too far fetched for my taste.  The movie is good.  I was very disappointed with the plot.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes very strong, dark, and dark movies.A very good movie for all ages.  Not the best but worth a watch.I had a little trouble watching this movie. I was happy to find out that it was a movie I was sure I would like. The movie was a little slow but still entertaining.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!"

Pet_Supplies_5,3.0,OR,"For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy."

The first one we ordered came damaged but Amazon true to form had the damaged one picked up and a new set in our greedy little hands in under three days.  But why the one star?

Had problems getting to customer service but when we did get them tech was nice and very helpful.  He had me do a Hard Reset.  It worked....until six hours later and it went back to turning on by itself.  I really wanted this set but in the end it was too much of a hassle.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"I wear a 8.5 US (41.5 UK) in Chuck Taylors and Merrills. The La Sportiva fits the same, but is tighter around the middle of the foot. This is as expected as this is my third pair of shoes from La Sportiva. The shoes are very comfortable, and what you'd expect from a hiking shoe. The lacing system is unique and incorporates a lace that goes around the back of the shoe and is tightened when you cinch up the top laces. That makes the show a bit more snug. If you need a wide shoe, I wouldn't recommend these. If you like a snug, secure fit and have an average-width foot, these are great. In my past experience La Sportiva are virtually indestructible. I still have my original two pair but because the sole lugs are worn down use them only for yard work and dock underwater work.

I did not know that he had access to her in such a personal way through a friendship that lasted over 20 years.  She took him under her wing and it helps explains his success as one of the best interviewers I have seen.  Tavis, whom I admire, lets his guests speak what is in their hearts with little interruption yet through skillful guidance.  All of those precious moments with the wise Dr. Maya surely added to his views and open-mindedness about life in general.  This is a great read and I could not put it down.  I saw her speak in Boston and I have read and cherished most of her works, but this puts an even greater spin on her illustrious life.  Thank you, Tavis Smiley.  I feel that I know her even better, now."
Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"What a weird little flick. This 62 minute quickie, directed by Jack Hill and Stephanie Rothman, is about as odd an entry as I've seen in this type of movie. It's set in Venice CA. though much of the architecture seems European. It involves an artist who is the descendant of another, centuries earlier, artist who was put to death for witchcraft, though somehow it caused him to turn into a vampire. He now paints women in the throes of death, kills them and dips them in acid.

I understand this was culled from other movies which explains having two directors and why the villain has two separate visages. But those other movies must have been pretty bad as they still only ended up with a 62 minute flick. The black and white cinematography, particularly in the night scenes, is stunning. And the story contains some odd notes. How many movies have you seen that try to fuse art with quantum physics? And one of the scenes is set up as though it were one of Salvidor Dali's paintings. It's a real eye opener. There is some fun jabbing at the sensibilities of artists and some pretty good cheese cake in the form of Lori Saunders in a bikini.

It's cool seeing Sid Haig in his early days but, like much of the rest of the movie, it's just a curiosity. The whole thing doesn't quite hang together. Plus, the villain resides in a church tower his ancestor resided in in the 11th century. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe there was a United States in the 11th century. Still, though, this is a lot of fun and it's short enough and whacked enough to warrant the attention of ardent film fans."

Surly may have tightened up their quality control after receiving complaints about the welding.  The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,4.0,OR,"We are heading to Maui and are planning a snorkel trip to the Molokini crater, but have gotten the worst sunburns from snorkeling in the past, because the sunscreen washes off so quickly in the salt water.

Pros
- My son really liked this rash guard/sunscreen top.
- The unique white stitching gives it some style (over just plain black).
- We ordered one size up from his normal size, and it fits quite snugly, so the sizing is about
  two sizes smaller than his typical American size shirt.
- It is well sewn and dries quickly.

Cons
- If ordering again, he would probably order two sizes up from his normal size.

I would purchase this product again.

I often depend on others leaving honest reviews when I need to order a new item.  I find that one of the most difficult things about ordering online is that I cant hold or touch the products before buying them.  So, I love reviews from others who have touched, inspected, and used the item Im thinking about purchasing.  I strive for the same in leaving reviews for others  to leave a review that will help others make an informed decision (never to inflate the product's quality). I received this item at a discount or gratis from the manufacturer or a seller to objectively test and review it, but received no payment and have no obligation to offer anything other than my real opinion based on my experience.

Anyway, the Florida historical information is rich and believable and Dorsey includes enough truth in his work to make you think maybe the Sunshine state residents are sniffing the Coppertone a bit too enthusiastically.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,I bought this to use with my tablet and games I own because in some games it would be much easier to use a controller than pressing the screen like Metal Slug. Unfortunately the maker states more compatibility than it really has. I can get some games to kinda work and others don't work with it at all. It says there is tons of games on the market it is compatible with but only shows me 20 and I don't own any of them. I am currently trying it with other controller programs and some of them could work it better than Nyko's own program which is frankly sad. I want to be able to use and love this controller more and hope Nyko improves their program and compatibility more.

Movies_and_TV_5,1.0,OR,"Anyone with knowledge of Anne and Mary Boleyn and their relationships with Henry VIII will see that this is tabloid fiction, pure and simple. The timetables and events are total fabrications. Yes, Anne was alleged to have had relationships with her brother. But to see this depicted as fact in this movie? Well, just look at the costumes. I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.

Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good."
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Lifeboat (Alfred Hitchcock, 1944)

You take a John Steinbeck story, have Jo Swerling (Pennies from Heaven) adapt it, and get Alfred Hitchcock to direct, with a cast including Tallulah Bankhead, William Bendix, Hume Cronyn, Henry Hull, and Walter Slezak, among others. How can you not have a hit?

Lifeboat is a simple tale: a ship has gone down, torpedoed by a German U-Boat that was destroyed soon after. A number of survivors struggle to a lifeboat, one of whom is a crewman from the U-Boat. Second-guessing, paranoia, and power struggles ensue. The best thing to do: get out of the way. And that's pretty much what Hitchcock does; each of these characters is invested with a distinct, well-drawn personality, and given the situation, they're bound to clash on their own. Change a camera angle here and there, perhaps, but let the characters do their thing. There's a minimal plot (regarding, of course, the eeeeeeeeevil German-- let's remember this film was released during the darkest days of World War II), but this is a movie that's really about these characters and how they interact with one another. And it's fascinating."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!"

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"Schleich's North America Giant Volcano with T-Rex Playset is a beautiful piece of art and very instructional toy. It's immaculately detailed and textures are exquisite, especially on the dino's. There are so many details to point out and explain to your little one as you play together and I'm surprised by how much my little 5 year old loved this set. The bones were especially cool to see.
That said, Schleich's Giant Volcano Playset is a vinyl monstrosity that is a chore to put together very cumbersome to store anywhere. The material is soft vinyl and just weighs a ton. It came in 5 or 6 pieces and held together by these tiny brittle pegs that was an utter nightmare to assemble. Just a very poor design choice of material. Definitely bad if your little one is prone to throw things - each of the pieces from this set is hefty and will cause some damage. many of the highlighted features don't work too well or was embarrassingly underwhelming - ie: the ""exploding wall"" the wall pieces had to be assembled into the nook and pressing the button pushes the pieces over - kind of. The flaw here is that the pieces are so heavy, the notch of plastic that knocks over the wall can barely budge the pieces and they pretty much just slide down. The tree snaps just hasn't worked yet. The roots don't stay agape and the spring snap doesn't really do much. About the only thing that does work is the Dino jail gate and even that contraption seems over engineered.
Flaws aside, the set is very beautiful but alarmingly over priced at almost a hundred dollars. Ouch! I get it - it's vinyl and hefty and very detailed - almost like a model kit but $100 is just too much for such badly engineered play. However, it is great if you're a Schleich fan."

When Kris devises a way to get Ivy with him again it works and Ivy becomes Kris's concubine; flouting the wishes of his parents and breaking a betrothal.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"For many years now, I've been a fan of the true crime genre; reading nothing but these nonfiction tales of the worst side of mankind. After a while, while still interested in the crimes, the forensics, and the inner workings of the justice system, a reader can easily reach a point where the crime in and of itself has no shock value.

That was not the case in my most recently read book: Pure Murder by Corey Mitchell.

In Pure Murder, Mitchell tells the gut-wrenching, absolutely sickening tale surrounding the deaths of two Houston, Texas teenager girls: Jennifer Ertman and Elizabeth Pena.

On what should have been a short walk home through on of Houston's city parks, these young girls had the bad fortune of meeting up with six of Texas' teenage lowlifes: Efrain Perez, Raul Villarreal, Peter Cantu, Joe Medellin, Venancio ""Yuni"" Medellin, Jr., and Sean O'Brien.

Simply because the young, innocent girls were in the wrong place at the wrong time when these scumbags were ""feeling their oats,"" they were tortured, raped, and murdered.

For the first time in a while, this true crime piece managed to enrage me as I could not hardly fantom that in a group of six people there was not one decent individual that could have, in some way, helped these young victims.

And, as an added bonus, especially in a time where illegal immigration is such a hot topic, the attempts by Joe Medellin to use his illegal immigrant status as a means to absolve the indictment against him was, to say the least, infuriating. He participates in the raping, mutilating and murder of two young girls and he expects that this country will allow him freedom on a technicality?! I could not even begin to understand the audacity of this pathetic, spineless child killer.

If you're up for a good read that evokes so many emotions you feel as though you are on an emotional rollercoaster, look no further than this newest release from Corey Mitchell."

My phone is less than a year old -- from which I ordered the boots and damn near everything else I buy -- so it's not my technology, either.
Just be warned that the Rio Grande isn't quite as it appears on your screen.
It's also just a little snug in the width. I bought a nine when I normally where an 8.5, knowing I'll be standing in them a while, and my feet will swell a bit. A nine with no socks still is a touch snug at the widest part of my foot (no, I don't wear WW shoes)."

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

Now as high school is coming to a close the pair have decided to attend a party but when Vivienne separates from Ray to use the restroom their world is torn apart in an instant.

Twenty years after the massive event happened that claimed the lives of a lot of the other teens in attendance at the part Vivienne appears out of nowhere. Everyone she knew has aged even though she hasn't at all. Vivienne longs for Ray to also return but when he doesnt she dedicates her life to figuring out time travel to hopefully save Ray from whatever event had sucked her into the future.

A Betrayal of Time by Lucia Ashta is a novella length fantasy read that had a great story of lovers ripped apart but would do anything to be together again. The town thought it was an earthquake that had stolen the lives of their children until the day Vivienne appeared again. Once it was known that she wasn't the only one whos body hadnt been recovered she dedicates her life to figuring out what had happened.

While being a short read the author did a wonderful job weaving together the time travel along with letting the readers know enough about the characters to care about their outcome. This is definitely one Id recommend to the fantasy/time travel lovers out there.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Ruthie Knox is a new to me author. About Last Night put her on my must buy list. The characters are realistic with flaws for both Cath and Nev that makes your heart ache for them on their journey for their HEA (happily ever after).

Cath comes from a hard life where she regrets choices she made. She doesn't feel worthy of Nev. She puts limitations on their relationship to keep from making the same mistakes. Gradually, the limitations change as Cath changes.

Nev has his own struggles with family and career choice. He goes along with Cath's limitations because he wants to breakdown the walls around her heart. However, for them to find their HEA, Nev also makes changes to merge together the two sides of his character (who he is and who his family wants him to be).

This combination of character struggles and development makes for a great read that had me turning the pages eager to see what would happen next and how they would overcome it all for HEA.

The book is set in England. Ms. Knox did a great job of writing Nev true to his background with English terms and sayings that added to the story and character.

I recommend this book to any reader looking for a great contemporary romance that will tug at your heart and make you smile."

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"Dangerous Territory is an intriguing and exciting romance that takes you into the heart of the war in Afghanistan and into the heat of battle.  Grace Grainger is a journalist and a very good one.  She chooses to spend her time reporting on the lives of those who defend their country, living with them, much like her own tour of duty and is actually ""embedded"" into the team she is with.  Air Force Master Sergeant Josh Travers is a Pararescue Jumper and has done more than his share of tours overseas.  Both of them fantasize about the hot night they had with a stranger several years in the past, and both find themselves very surprised when in the heat of battle, the Pararescuer that comes to save the group Grace is with is the same hottie she got nasty with 3 years ago.

Thrown together in the middle of Afghanistan, the chemistry between these two is undeniably electric, despite the circumstances they find themselves in.  Then, there is the fact that Josh ""hates"" reporters, which presents a different problem.  The danger, drama, and romance in Dangerous Territory will keep you on the edge of your seat, while you fan your face from the heat that isn't even coming from the desert.  I enjoyed this military romantic suspense story, which is something different that I usually don't read, and was a very welcome change that I enjoyed.  I look forward to following this series to see what Emmy Curtis has in store for her readers next."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a valuable book for our generation, and I wished it has a more populist version.  It's a textbook for Stanford engineering and senior science students.  Much of it is readable by anyone with basic science courses; but remember reading your first year's physics books, the ones with physics problems at the end?  Take this up another notch, with requiring completion of second year math.

My peers went on to highly successful careers in engineering and sciences; I transferred to a liberal arts school.  I'm always highly suspicious of math equations to explain lots of things, and find this slows readings quite a bit.

But, if you happen to enjoy wading through a few math equations, this is an excellent comprehensive introduction to renewal  energy.  Its writing style is outstanding as well."

It's excellent on fruits with a natural wax or tough rind like orange because of the ridging helps keep the item you're slicing on the knife. I've had an orange slip while I was trying to cut it with a smooth blade, not fun. My only qualm is that for some reason this knife's sheath is not like the rest the sheath has a little part that allows it to stand which keeps it from fitting into the drawers with the other knives because it is a bit bulky.

It was so good. I am so glad I did! It's a great story and it's a great book. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a great mystery. I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading the next one in the series. I am a big fan of Ms. King, and I hope she continues to write better. I've read all of the 3 books in this series. I have no idea how to describe them. I don't really know how to put them all together. I know that this is a short book, and that there is no other way to describe it. But it's so well written that I didn't care for it at all. I would recommend it to anyone who loves mystery books. If you're looking for a quick, enjoyable read, this is it. I will not be reading the rest of the series. This is a good book. It's a fast paced, easy to read read book. The characters are well developed and the plot is very believable.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this to control a basement dehumidifier.  I mounted it in an electrical box with a receptacle and plug my dehumidifier into it.  It seems to work well.  Turning the knob all the way CCW is OFF and all the way CW is ON with markings from 80 to 20 in between.  I have mine set at about 52, which seems to keep the humidity in my basement around 60 percent.  I would say the markings are approximate so it's best to have a separate inexpensive humidity monitor so you know the humidity level is where you want it.  I used a 2 gang electrical box but a 3 gang would have been a better fit as this device is much wider than a switch or receptacle so I had to trim the cover to make everything fit.  This would have been avoided with the wider box."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"After the problems with the rights for the 1966 Batman TV show were fixed, they finally released an action figure series.  I have been waiting for a figure of this Batman for decades.  Now I finally have one in my hands, and I'm unmistakably pleased (but not in a filthy way, just pleased).

Before everything, as usual, ignore the first production picture and just go straight for the pictures of the figure in the box, or the customer images if you want to know what the figure really looks like.  I'll give you a hint: it looks amazing.  The detail is wonderful.  Not only they perfectly captured the look of the series, but the figure has very good articulation too.  And while it's almost invisible in the pictures, the utility belt has the classic bat emblem too.

Like all the other ones in the series, it comes with a stand and a collectible card, with some artwork of Batman on the front and part of a Batcave wide image in the back, which is completed with the other cards.  The figure is perfectly able to stand on its own, since the feet are large enough and the cape is thankfully made out of light fabric rather than heavy plastic.

Like the other figures, this one has no accesories.  Which is kind of a shame, since Batman had a lot of crazy gadgets in the old series.  I'd have gladly paid double if the figure had come with a small can of Shark-Repelent spray.  No matter.  The figure on its own is a great accomplishment and it's very well crafted, so it's worth 5 stars."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"I was looking for a good way to refrigerate wine bottles that are partially empty. If you put a stopper in them and stand them up in the fridge door, they clank and jostle around when you open or close the fridge. And if you lay them on their sides, there's always the chance the stopper you're using won't be as secure as you'd hoped, and you end up with a leaky mess. This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around. You can even bend the lower part of the rack down just enough to increase the tilt of the bottles if you wish. And of course, this thing is a big space saver. Perfect."

You could guess what was gong to happen with Mic and Jordan. Ha! J.B. fools you completely. The book takes you where you didn't expect to go. You learn more about Mic. And just when you think things are going to heat up, a different sort of excitement happens and you are left wondering now what?

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"A little deeper than most. In addition to the plot, it examines the aftermath of extreme emotional cruelty (as well as physical abuse) to a wife at the hands of her husband; the doubts and insecurities of a hero who therefore seems more genuine than the usual ""tall, dark, and brooding""; and an old lady in the throes of dementia, possibly Alzheimer's. This book tends toward the inner life of the characters over the action, but the various relationships feel genuine. There is a mystery that could have had more detailed development for my taste, but there was a sufficiently evil villain, a thrilling confrontation and a resolution. I found this book because I was laughing at the various offerings of sex scenes wrapped in imitation stories and was sure this would be one of those, based on the bare chested man on the cover. The description intrigued me and I am happy to have stumbled upon it. Although there is sex, it is not the focus, so it doesn't detract from the story."

There is a lot of information, it's a big book.  But I think the science is important and worth knowing.  For example, why is it easier for men to lose weight?  How do hormones affect out bodies and our weight issues?

So, once you get past the super-interesting science of women's health and bodies, there is a 3 week plan for changing eating habits.  It isn't like a diet book in that there aren't TONS of recipes, more like example recipes so a woman can structure her own diet in a healthy way.  There are no photos.

Recipes look good but some of them, by famous chefs especially, are complicated with many ingredients and many steps.  If that's your thing, you'll like it.

I found the book informative and helpful.  I am going to try the breakfast changes first.  I like understanding how my body works differently from a man's and how that changes how I should go about eating and taking care of myself.

Very good, informative book for readers who like a lot of information."

Brainy lab scientist Laura Manning has got a two big problems 1) she has to present the findings of her lastest project to the broard in a little over one week and 2) that would be easier if she didn't have sexier-than-sin Jay Cutler as her lab partner, all added to the fact that someone is out to get their secret files on the project by any means. So exactly how are they going to test their 'pleasure control' drug without anyone finding out their results before they present them to the board? -on themselves of course! Laura thinks that this is all in the name of science, but Jay has other ideas and after the 'experiments' are over, he's thinking of a more permanent relationship. But, ""Wildman"" Jay Cutler has really got his work cut out for him because Laura has a hard time believing it's her that he wants and not because he was under the influence of the pleasure drugs.

This is a really good debut. A very hot book. If your looking for lots of  scorching hot love scenes in a contemporary then this one is for you.  But my biggest gripe is the length, which is a little over 200 hundred pages with large type. I think the author could have added another 100 pages easily (perhaps it's the fault of the editors?). It was just over too fast for me and the overall scenes could have been more descriptive. I did enjoy it though and I'll definitely be getting the sequel. There's lots of room for improvement, but I think that Fox has a good start.

A very good short and heavy-on-the-love-scenes contemporary read."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I absolutely loved the second book in this series Plush 2 was phenomenal K.B. Winters has done an amazing job in writing this series so far.

The second book picks up exactly where the first leaves off Allison is going through a rough time now that she has lost her job and she believes that Cooper was behind it all along. This book you will really find that you will have a love hate relationship with Cooper while he is absolutely charming and sweeps Allison off of her feet at times he also acts like a complete and total jerk during others, so in other words a complete and total alpha male (sinfully delicious yes please!). This book leaves you will a lot of questions at the end like whether or not this is going to work out for Allison and Cooper. Will he be able to change his ways? Will Allison finally be able to catch a break?

K.B. Winters did such a fantastic job writing this book it was full of drama, suspense, action and some hot and steamy sex scenes the chemistry between Allison and Cooper in this book is so great it just grabs you and makes you feel like you are right there along for the ride with them. She does such a great job of bringing the reader along and making them feel like they are a part of they story.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My four-year-old daughter loves Disney Junior, and while she'll watch Miles from Tomorrowland, it's never been one of her favorites. As a result, this Photon Flyer was our first Miles toy. My daughter apparently recognized the craft from the show and immediately began to play with it.

Although the Miles figure glows and the wings light up, it's actually pretty basic for a toy vehicle these days.  The wings fold back a little for ""surface mode,"" and the nose of the craft can slightly extend for ""hyper speed mode,"" but that's about it. On the one hand, it opens a door for fun and imagination, but I think my youngest was a bit disappointed that it didn't at least make sounds.

Of course, this Photon Flyer works best when combined with other Miles toys that we do not have. It fits into a sold-separately toy called the Stellosphere, which -- according to the box -- ""amps up"" this toy with sounds, more lights, and larger wings. So at the moment, our vehicle is not ""amped up,"" nor do we have accessories (none included) to store in the ship's cute cargo hold. Although my daughter creatively put some Lion Guard stuff in there and promptly added Lion Guard figures to her Miles missions. And finally, the box prominently shows the Merc figure (not included) who has his own custom seat and moon roof in the flyer.

All in all, if you have other Miles toys already, this Photon Flyer is a great addition to any collection. It works great with other figures, accessories, and the Stellosphere set. If, like us, it's all on its own in the Miles universe, you'll likely be encouraged by your child to expand your collection... Unless they want to enlist other friends, like the Lion Guard, in their space adventures."

Keyboard is a biggie for me and I give it a favourable rating. Trackpad is giving me hell. I had a great time with the synaptics software on my the lenovo I traded this in for. But the software that supports this trackpad is oversenstive. Cursor flies all over the place doing all kinds of madness while I'm typing. Constantly stopping to undo what it has done.

I would give it 5 stars,but you just can't compare it to to the previous two. I was real glad to see Sam Neil return as Dr. Grant. He may not be the most popular actor, but he's a good one. The special effects were great as usual. ""The Lost World's"" visuals weren't a whole lot better than the first one, but you can tell a significant difference in Jurassic Park III. The dino's are more detailed and relistic looking than the other two movies. The music on the other hand wasn't as good. John Williams didn't conduct the score for this one, so the music didn't quite have the same touch as the other two. Of course the movie had it's cheesy parts.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"The cover art of headless viewers watching television says it all. My only brush with the late Neil Postman came when he spoke at the university I was attending in the northwest. A breezy east coaster, he was unaware of the need to step on eggs. During the questions, one woman said, ""Mr. Postman, how can we help children have self-esteem?"" to which he replied, ""I don't want them to have self-esteem; I want them to esteem something other than themselves.""

After the stunned silence I and a few others rose and started clapping; it was very much as if life had been returned to Pepperland in Yellow Submarine. I've been clapping inwardly ever since, as when I read this book.

There are hundreds of reviews of this book, which created a stir everywhere. Everyone (except the people running TV) seems to have read it. Most readers find it smooth going. However, those who don't want to tackle the book can still wrestle with the ideas. In Postman's essay collection, Conscientious Objections, he replies to the question ""Why are books so long?"" with the answer that they don't have to be, and as an example gives a short version of this book.

The basic thesis is that along with George Orwell's 1984 in which civilization lapses into a dystopia (opposite of a utopia) ruled by oppression and violence, there was the opposite vision in Aldous Huxley's Brave New World that society would be destroyed by indulgence in pleasure. Postman says that while you can make a good case for the first view, the second is in full swing. Now if only the desperate networks would read this book and (re)turn to making good TV."

The first book in the series is a two part story about the lives of two people, Torey and Danielle, that takes place in the future in the same city as the rest of the characters.  The story is about a woman who is a single mom, who had to work on her own daughter's education.  She has a son who is a vet and she is trying to get a college degree.  She is trying to find a job, but she does not get any.  She is in a difficult situation, and her husband is trying to take her away from her.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is my second read by K'wan and once again I was not disappointed! Kwan draws you in with his colorful characters and doesn't let you go until the last page. Street Dreams is about guy name Rio from the projects who starts off being just nickel and dime dealer from around the way, but when he's approached by Prince, the king of the streets..Rio's lifestyle quickly starts to change for the good for him.  But when Prince's oldest son, Truck is released from prison all hell breaks loose out of jealousy.

I instantly fell in love with Trinity(Rio's girlfriend), Shamel(his longtime childhood friend), Sally(his Mom) and Cutty(another one of his friends).  Street Dreams is by far one of the BEST books I've read in a long time!  K'wan keeps you on the edge of your seat chapter after chapter and snatches your breath away at the very end!

Street Dreams is HIGHLY recommended for readers who love drama, suspense, action, love and edge of the seat writing all in one! (Hoodrat by him also comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!)

Keep'em coming K'wan!!!"
Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Admittedly, casting Atlanta Braves' bad boy John Rocker as a serial killer was an inspired piece of casting.  However, big John is hardly in the film at all.  Which means we're left with a cast of really bad actors running around in their bathing suits and what not, and even with some innovative methods of offing the victims, THE GREENSKEEPER breaks no new ground in the art of film-making.  There are, however, some priceless lines:  having three of the boytoys named Chad, Chet and Chuck (or something like that); when one of the bimbos has to cancel her vacation because the island is being taken over by guerillas, she innocently says ""I didn't even know they had a zoo.""

I'm just hoping that the heel portion of the shoe will loosen up after a few wearings. Overall, I'd say it's a good shoe, but I'm not sure how long it'll last. I've had a few pairs of shoes that have been too tight, and these are the only ones I've found that have lasted me at least a full season. I've had a few pairs of this brand, and I think I've found some that do. I'm still waiting on a return, but I'm sure I'll find a better shoe, and I'm going to try them on next time I'm wearing them.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"This toy is amazing - and is in no way for kids only!  It was intended for my youngest nephew who does in fact adore it and carries it around with him, but his older brothers who are both teenagers also couldn't stop for lack of a better word ""playing"" with it.  In fact, he had to fight them off for playing rights!  When I first received it, I unboxed it to make sure everything was alright and you do need to put on the sticker decals according to the diagram on the box, and I've got to say that even for me as an adult seeing what it all does so I could explain it to him was actually quite fun for me too.

The Millennium Falcon itself is much larger than I imagined, making it even cooler for kids, and it's fantastic that they also included a Hans, Chewie, and R2D2 figure rather than making you buy all the people separately (though there is plenty of room for extra figures from the movie to buy on your own for even more fun).  There's so much you can do inside the Millennium Falcon too.  There are trap doors, a Jedi training station, a movable ladder, seats for your figures, blasting rockets, and a cockpit you can open and close.  For the adults and teens it was just a tad disappointing that the cockpit only sits one so Hans and Chewbacca can't both sit in there together like in the movies, but the youngest didn't seem to mind at all.

This really is so much fun for the young and young at heart.  If you were a huge Star Wars fan back in the day this is a must to get for your kids - and that way you can play with it too!"

Books_5,4.0,OR,"Add this book to the growing pile of books to give a child waiting desperately for the next (and final) installment in the Harry Potter series. This may make the wait a little less unbearable, though nothing will be much solace once J.K. Rowling pens the last page in Book 7. There's only so much one can do about that, after all.

The Thief of Always is also a great choice for anyone smitten by Lemony Snicket, as it features a similarly dark story line with menacing adult characters. There's none of the wonderful banter between author and reader found in A Series of Unfortunate Events, nor really any of the wickedly twisted humor, but there should be just enough terror and danger to keep most fans of this genre riveted.

Harvey Swick is 10 years old and very bored with the long, cold days of February. One day a mysterious man appears, suddenly, in Harvey's room. The man asks Harvey if he'd like to go someplace where life is always fun. Being a self-centered yet somewhat strangely trusting 10 year old, Harvey agrees, and he's led away by the man.

The house where the mysterious man takes Harvey is in a land that's always sunny during the day. Halloween and Christmas, those two revered favorite holidays of children, come every evening. Harvey and another boy, Wendell, have all their wishes granted in this wondrous house, but one day Harvey starts to see that all isn't as it should be, and evil lurks beneath the facade of perfection...

A quick and satisfying read, this is as entertaining for adult fans of the genre as children."

The handle is straight, and it's not really stiff enough to hold a finger. This is a problem for most people. The only real flaw is that the grip is too loose. I've had this tool for a few years now and it's still strong. However, I would not recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a sturdy, secure, and comfortable hand grip. I'm glad I found this tool, because it was a pleasure to use. The company I work for should have started to make better tools. This is a great tool for getting things done at home. It's sturdy, holds a great angle, and is a good value. I don't recommend this tool to anyone who is looking for a good quality tool. I really like the quality of this knife. It's sharp and very well made. I don't like the way the blade is curved, but it's a nice knife for my needs. The blade is made of metal, which means it's not sharpened like a regular blade. The knife is sharp enough to be used in a pinch, but that's okay because it's not meant for everyday use.

It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely.

It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,It does a good job of filtering the water but even a new filter is so slow! And you have to fill the upper container twice to get it to 2/3rds full. Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"I have a very high instep, got it from my grandma, and a bunch of family members suffer with the issue as well, including my son, aunt and sister.  Those are the ones I know about.  It's a problem for getting shoes that fit at all, especially shoes I can wear for any length of time.

Amazon is my go-to place for shoes that have the sizes I need.  There is no guarantee the shoes will be comfortable.  It's entirely the fault of my feet, and not the shoes.

The problem with a high instep is most shoes are not really comfortable.  This particular shoe cut into the top of my foot.  It's not a cut that bleeds, certainly, but it's definitely a huge indentation in the top of my foot, which goes away in a few hours.  I wore them for a wedding, my son's wedding, and I literally had to take them off to go down the stairs to walk down the aisle with my son and husband.  They were actually too big, and I was afraid they would fall off down the stairs, which would make me trip.

When I find a shoe that works for my feet and keeps my feet from pain, I will be faithful to the brand.  Skechers is one I can rely upon for the wide size I need and the comfort I deserve.

The price of these shoes was outstanding!"

The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

I tend to like heavier watches and watches with the larger wrist pieces but I know that is not everyone's taste.  The only advice I have is to mind to the size.

LOVE this beam.  Came in two packages.  Opened both the packages and just dropped the beam into the legs and voila, instant beam.  No assembly required.  VERY sturdy.  My husband who is 6' 4"" and 215 pounds had no problem walking across it.  The beam did not bend.  Obviously, my husband won't be using it daily.  But I wanted to see if it could really support 200+ pounds like claimed.  ( I believe I read 250 lb)  But my 50lb daughter is the primary user.  But like said, no problem supporting him.  So I am pleased that my daughter will be able to use it for a long time.

I love the height of this beam.  Tall enough so you don't feel like it's on the floor and you can practice scoops.  But low enough that you don't get scared to practice new skills.  I also like the option to purchase leg in the future to increase the height.

The set assembles fairly easily and for the most part stays together.  We use it more as a decoration to store her ponies on the shelf nicely. Since it is so flat, the ponies can go in front of it.

Movies_and_TV_5,3.0,OR,"After watching Hypocrites, it is interesting to me that even in the early years of filmmaking, movies could be extremely complex and thought provoking. Hypocrites is definitely those two things. The writer and director of the film, Lois Weber, uses the characters of a preacher and Truth (portrayed as a naked woman) to reveal the hypocrisy of society. Though Weber's intentions were most likely to speak on morality, it is interesting that she chose to use a fully nude woman throughout the film to draw in an audience that would not have otherwise seen the film. It was also surprising to me that this film would have been viewed by religious audiences with such unapologetic nudity. However, I will say that whatever could be viewed as indecent may have been made up for by the moral of the film. As the preacher succumbs to a dream, he is taken to an earlier time when he first finds Truth. The preacher then goes around aiming to show Truth to people, only to get rejected every time. In each situation, Truth reveals the true character of people to be corrupt. I feel that the overall story of the film was very well written. However, I found it a little bit difficult to get into the film because of the melodramatic style of acting. Because there was no sound in film at the time, the acting seemed to be more expressive and a lot less realistic. If anything made this film difficult to watch, it would be that. Although, overall I enjoyed the film and felt that Weber was successful in presenting her case of morality. I would be interested in seeing what a modern cast and crew could do with the story. I would love to see someone else's spin on it."

In order to hear ANY sound at all, the box had to be placed on MAXIMUM volume, AND I had to set my stereo on ""acid rock concert"" volume level, to hear ANY sound, at all.  In short, to hear any volume, at all, I had to set the volume so loud that, for any other device, I would have had noise complaints, from my neighbors.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Headline:
Summerlong was a surprise hit for meits darker and edgier than the cover would lead you to believe.

Major Themes:
Marriage, mid-life crises, general discontent, maintaining your identity through motherhood

What I Loved:
- The very beginning of this one was just okay, but I liked it more and more the farther I read.
- You can really feel this bookthe simmering suburban discontent, everyone having an itch thats just waiting to be scratched, the restlessness that comes with sweltering summer days. Its like a sea of smoldering embers threatening to ignite at the slightest catalyst.
- The cast of characters is delightfully eclectic and everyone is dealing with their own issuesthe unhappily married housewife (Claire), the failing and desperate real estate agent (Don), the grieving lover (ABC), and the actor returning home to tie up loose ends (Charlie). And, best of all.
- Ruth Manetti (she deserves her own bullet)! This eighty-some year old pothead gives the best life adviceI decided she needs to be my shrink!

You see? Ruth says. This is why I like you more than anybody else. When I give you the straight dope, you don't reel off some optimistic bulls***.

- Bakopoulos nails the issue of women losing their identities during motherhood. I highlighted so many passages pertaining to this issue that made me think yes, thats exactly how it is. And, Im even more impressed given hes male!

What I Didnt Like:
The ending fizzled a bit and partially revolved around the storyline I was the least invested in. But, it didn't bother me that much because this book was about the journey and I enjoyed that immensely.

A Defining Quote:
Something happened to me, Claire says. I don't know what. I stopped wanting things. And now? he says. Now, she says, I just want.

Good for People Who Like:
Books set in the Midwest, books about marriage, books about motherhood, gorgeous writing, quirky characters, small town life

I've had to replace the battery in one of the original remotes. It's a bit difficult to get the case open to replace the battery, but they last for around 5 years which seems pretty reasonable. The only indication that the battery was failing was a reduction in the operating range of the remote. Programming the remote is very simple (directions are provided with the unit), and it's nice to be able to use several remotes with both garage doors. The removable clip is nice, too, allowing you to carry the remote in a pocket with no sharp edges.

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Adam Schonberg is in medical school and trying to make ends meet without the support of either his or his wife, Jennifer's, parents.  His family was not happy when he married outside the Jewish religion.  Now he finds that their already struggling family of two is about to be a family of three and he doesn't know how to cope or manage financially.  Jennifer will have to quit her job as a dancer and so Adam decides to take a leave of absence from medical school to go work for a drug company.  But all is not what it seems with their fancy corporate headquarters and high dollar paychecks.  Adam soon finds himself in the middle of a corporate plan to take over the field of medicine by drugging and mind controlling as many doctors as the company can get their hands on.  All the while, Adam must deal with the conflict developing between Jennifer and himself because of his suspicions that her OBGYN is drugged as well.

Cook weaves an extremely interesting conspiracy theory about how the business world is beginning to affect medicine and it's treatment, or lack thereof, of patients.  It confronts the  idea that for-profit companies will continue to have an influence on the field of medicine that is not always as positive as these companies would lead you to believe.  The unfortunate aspect of this book was that the story line jumped from idea to idea a bit and often portrays Jennifer in a overly simplistic and patronizing manner.  Just when the adventure really heats up, the story ends abruptly and rather predictably.  A story with a lot of potential ended flat and in disappointment.  Still, one still finishes with the contemplation that Cook intended."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Kia can start fires without matches. It just happens and there's nothing she can do to stop it, fire is a part of her. She's got fiery red hair and when she gets emotional there are flames she can't control. She was kicked out of school because of a fire she started and is now living with her grandmother, who works on a large estate. Being there brings Kia more questions than answers. She finds out the hard way that the surrounding forest isn't safe. There are creatures she's never seen and they aren't very friendly.

Ethan is used to everything that lurks in the shadows. He knows a lot of terrible secrets and is carrying a heavy burden. He likes Kia from the start, but he knows she isn't safe at the estate. He keeps his distance, but Kia is too smart for him to continue hiding things. He's afraid of what will happen if she finds out the truth, there are sanctions Ethan wouldn't wish on anyone, especially Kia. Will he be able to protect her and does she actually need to be protected?

Red is a great story about an interesting house with a fascinating forest. I loved reading about each creepy creature and like Alyxandra Harvey's vivid imagination. Her main characters are easy to love, which automatically meant I loved the story. Kia is fierce and fabulous and Ethan is responsible and brave. They are opposites who complement each other. Therefore they are a good match and I enjoyed reading about their numerous adventures.

I loved the fact that Kia has fire. It was fun to read about her abilities. She's passionate and the fire shines through in everything she does and it's the base of her personality, which is something that made me smile. Alyxandra Harvey's vivid descriptions of the forest and everything that's lurking there are fabulous. I loved her colorful and creepy monsters and the fact that the story is mostly about what it's like to be both the hunter and the prey. I really enjoyed reading this fast-paced adrenaline-packed story."
Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Countdown is a short prequel to the Newsflesh series. I have previously reviewed the first two books in the series: Feed and Deadline. I read the Kindle version of Countdown so it didn't have page numbers but I think it probably has only about 65 pages. It's a detailed account of the days in 2014 leading up to The Rising.

Mira Grant is an excellent world builder. Adding more details to the story of how the Kellis-Amberlee virus was created and spread only made the possibility that something like that could really happen seem even more believable to me. There wasn't any brand new information in this book but it was a nice dose of the Newsflesh world to help tide me over until the final book, Blackout, is released this summer. I highly recommend Countdown for fans of the Newsflesh series."

I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Fitting that the first release of Risk Europe is replete with Euro style gaming techniques and rules.  This isn't simple, old school Risk... (Ukraine is weak!!!), but a new, fresh, updated version with several new rules.  I hope they release some additional twists on classic Risk, such as an Asian edition with focus on Korea, Japan, and China.

Players don't strive to eliminate opponents.  Instead players try to collect crowns to become the Emperor of Europe.  Each player selects their starting city and draws two orders from their eight.  These dictate the actions the player will be undertaking during their turn.  Players acquire money, build castles, build units, and attack opposing players.

Combat is slightly different than classic Risk as well.  It is more thought out with players forced to use more strategy in battle.

Overall this is a well balanced game with a lot of more involved player participation.  Players don't get eliminated, making it more fun over the long term than classic Risk (for those eliminated players especially).  Components are high quality.  And Ukraine (Galicia) is still weak!

Recommended.  Great for Euro gamers or those wanting a more complex American style board game to bridge that gap between American and Euro games."

If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,"So all my life I've been cooking with wooden spoons so I don't ding up the metal pots (nylon spoons warp and melt - hate them). I'm also a dishwasher kind of gal, hate doing dishes by hand. When I found out that these wooden spoons can go straight in the dishwasher I was like ""is that even possible?!"" In addition, I have the Epicurean cutting boards and love them (also stick them in the dishwasher!). So we got these Epicurean spoons and I'm ready to throw all other cooking utensils away. I'm so glad they come as a pack of 3 because I use them daily when cooking. I'm also the type of gal that leaves a spoon in a pot and walks away to do another task in the kitchen (I ruin a lot of good spatulas that way); these spoons can withhold the high heats while left in the pan.

There are 3 different utensils it comes with. My fiance loves the flat straight edge one for cooking ground beef to separate the meat. I equally love the small and large spoon. The smaller spoon is like your typical thought of a wooden spoon and the large spoon is large but still usable like the smaller spoon, I use them interchangeably. The great news is they don't change the flavor or my cooking or retain any smells/flavors (I also sniff my dishes when they come out the dishwasher).

I think I'm going to get everyone this for Christmas. You don't have to cook with your momma's wooden spoons now! Great for dishwasher fans or a change to the typical wooden spoon."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,1.0,OR,I purchased the MM 520 because it seemed like a reputable company one year ago.  I was so wrong.  from the day of purchase nothing but problems.  This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

With R Burton and E Taylor playing opposite, and caught on film, there was simply no reason to try it again.  I still wonder when anyone does.

I don't get to know the real reason why he is homeless or the real facts about what he endured while being on the street. But his POV had a poignant feel to it that make my heart ache for this lonely man. Adam is a college kid and a world class jerk. He involuntarily volunteer in the shelter in order to get a good reference for college. His had a super-sized ego, rude, selfish, narcissist and etc. I'm sure his character is suppose to make people hate him, but I just laugh it off as part of the humor of the story. Every week Adam reluctantly went to the shelter passing our food parcel, while internally hating the work. This is where he met Tork, the green hair exotic creature that he was not suppose to be attracted to. Anyway, when Tork try to evade Adam at every turn, Adam who suffered a bruised ego, decided to start 'The Invasion of Tork', which I find it extremely sweet and funny despite his motive. Later, Adam start to realize that Tork is more than just a no-good-doer homeless man. Overall, despite the short length of the story and the lack of character background, I love this book and wish it was longer. Seriously. Such good stuff shouldn't be so short.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"This review is also posted on my blog: theshortreviewer.blogspot.com

I normally enjoy stories that are told through the viewpoint of someone you can feel for--you know, a good guy or girl. Being that I knew this story would be told through the eyes of someone truly evil, then I got past that and found myself both intrigued and utterly disgusted at the same time. I do like a good disturbing thriller after all. And this book certainly delivered on that.

Fearlessly written, the author holds absolutely nothing back. This is not an exaggeration. The main character is a serial killer, and you are taken into his sick and twisted mind. The repetitiveness of his thoughts is indicative of how I believe someone like him would think. I had no empathy for this character at all. I found myself hoping this was fiction and not an autobiography in disguise! That is how good of a job the author does with bringing you inside this psycho's demented world.

The story is graphic, and many of the scenes are deeply horrifying and troubling. And what is even more terrifying is that there are people out there who do commit atrocious crimes such as this. So even though this is fiction, it is probably more realistic than most of us would like to believe.

It often read more like a diary, where the killer tells a lot of his story, and the dialogue is limited. It was a short, quick read, and I do sincerely hope for a sequel. The story did not feel finished as there is definitely more to be told here.

I recommend this for anyone who thinks they can take it for what it is - a messed up and gritty story."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,Great little pots and pans. Great for the kids. My husband and I have been using this for a long time and it seems to last for the longest time. I would definitely recommend this product.
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"This is a very bright light that is marred by an oversimplified design on the elastic cord that hold the lights in place. But let's start at the beginning. This is a very nice Energizer headset that could have been a lot better except for American corporate insistence on not quite getting things as well as they might have.  They list their light at 150 lumens, which is respectable and serviceable, but certainly not one of the  brightest headsets on the markets. They claim to have made a technological adjustment that makes this four times brighter. But they aren't clear about this. If this is four times brighter, that would mean it is a 600 lumens. If it is 600 lumens, then why not say it? I suspect because it really is just a 150 lumens headset, but they want you to think it is rather more. Regardless, this bright enough for most lighting needs. Where it fails is the headband. I have a couple of other headlamps, and in both instances they constructed the headset with several pieces of elastic. This allows for a couple of things. It provides a more stable perch on the head, which it most certainly provides. It also provides a more comfortable perch for the headlamp. This is simply not a very comfortable headset to wear. The lone band really cuts into your skin when holding it. If you tried to wear this on your head  for any length of time you would begin to experience discomfort and most probably a pressure headache.

This is not a bad headlamp, but there are much better ones available for just about any need. I'm something of an Energizer/Duracel loyalist (I find the two brands to be almost indistinguishable from one another and I will continue to use both this and Duracel products, but this isn't one of Energizer's stronger products."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"My introduction to Sophia Henry and her Pilots series was through Power Play. Gaby and Landon had a meaty story but there was a disconnect for me. So I decided to try again with Interference. Ms. Henry is consistent in her willingness to tackle subjects that are painful. From the beginning she delivers that one, two punch. Complex people facing their demons and working to overcome them. Jason has baggage that has followed him into adulthood. From abandonment and trust issues, to an attraction that pulls the scab off a partially healed wound. Linden has worked to become a responsible young woman. An act of rebellion in her teens left her with more responsibility than she expected and the shame of disappointment. Interference redeemed Sophia Henry in my eyes.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"FRANK ALTOBELLI'S ""TRUE HEART"" (REVIEW)

This book was wonderful! It had the perfect amount of fantasy and adventure along with a love story that was sweet and unexpected. Mouse, the heroine of the novel is almost sprite-like in her mannerisms and you can tell she has a heart of gold. When she decides to leave her home rather than be given in marriage to a man she does not want or love she realized that the one she does care for has no feelings of the sort for her. All at once heart-breaking and yet insightful she realizes that her true love is a man she had never met before. Taking them on an adventure while leading them to their destination she finds her own destiny and learns things about herself that she never knew. This book is written with the imagination of a man that still seems to have a little of the young boy left in him. Frank Altobelli is a virtuoso at writing YA fantasy and I know we'll see more of him in the near future. -Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,OR,After reading countless reviews on coasters I choose this set. Many of the other types of coasters had common complaints of a dripping glass or glasses sticking to the coaster surface. Neither appealed to me. This set performs exactly as promised while adding a stylish accent to our newly purchased tables. I'd buy these again without hesitation. The cork backing protects the surface and the thirsty stone absorbs all the sweat from the glass.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,This is a great product and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who was interested in purchasing it. Totally awesome.
Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"in the description of the product it makes reference to these are rock and roll style boots. these boots are not limited to that. i wear gothic industrial clothing and these boots fit extremely well with buckle/bondage looks.

The quality is very good. i have read many reviews here that complain about the zipper being cheap and it breaks. i believe its the operator not the zipper that breaks them.  you loosen up the laces a bit before you unzip them so you don't over work the zipper. And the same when putting them on. if you have them laced tight and then think you going to jerk the zipper up the next time you are putting them on you are a idiot. the zipper is to make them easier to get on and off. not to do all the work because you are to lazy to loosen the laces first.

they arrived in excellent condition. even the factory box was flawless. they are a bit taller than the description reads. in my point of view. Im 6ft 3 and these boots come up to just below my knee. i have long legs. for a guy that is shorter id recommend the 3 buckle version just so they don't ride up on top of the knee. for woman if you have long legs these are perfect. although for some woman they might be a bit big (soul) to walk in. the soul is wide on the whole boot. i drive a manual transmission car. i can already see im not going to attempt to drive with them on. # pedals is not enough room. i will scuff them up when they rub each other when the clutch and brake are both being used together. driving a automatic transmission car there would be plenty of room. ill just put them on when i reach my destination.

Overall i am very happy with this purchase. met all expectations."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I loved Desiree Holt's book, Joy Ride.  As a matter of fact, I can honestly say that Joy Ride turned me into a Rock Band Romance Junky.  With that in mind, I'm here to tell you that Aftershock, the sequel to Joy Ride, has more than satisfied my appetite for this sub-genre of romance.

Aftershock is a truly amazing read.  In my opinion this story is even better than Joy Ride.  You do get to catch up on what's happening with the hero and heroine of Joy Ride, Marc and Emma, as well as getting to know the other members of the band Lightnin' a bit better.  But you also get to meet Sydney Alexander, newly named promotions agent for the happening, new-on-the-scene band Lightnin' who is hot, sexy yet somewhat troubled by some past life experiences and the nasty, bitter aunt who raised her after the death of her parents.  You get to learn more about Rick Trajean, leader of the band, Lightnin' while savoring all the sweet, sexy details of how Syd and Rick fall for each other.  Then hold on to your hats because things get a little wild when the nasty villain enters the picture.  Let me tell you.  Desiree Holt writes THE BEST villains and she sure doesn't disappoint in this story.  You are going to love hating this villain.

Desiree Holt is one of my absolute favorite authors.  I love her writing style.  Her characters are always so real.  The story line is always sure, succinct and sure to grab your attention.  All this is true in Aftershock but she goes beyond the usual.  I felt like I was really backstage listening to Lightnin' perform during the concert and interacting with everyone after the concert while reading this book. I highly recommend this book for your reading pleasure.  Aftershock is most definitely an Off-the-Charts #1 winner!"

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,3.0,OR,"Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"These stories are fantastic.  They are presented in chronological order, which is perfect for two reasons.  First, the ""easiest"" ones to read are first; these are the ones that are the most straightforward 50s- and 60s-era sf tales.  The later stories are more challenging, and more rewarding.  Second, the reader is able to follow the author's descent into madness.

Nearly all of the stories are great.  Among my favorites: Second Variety, Autofac, The Exit Door Leads In, and Rautavaara's Case.  Faith of Our Fathers is one of the most terrifying things I've ever read, and I Hope I Shall Arrive Soon is one of the most heartbreaking things I've ever read."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"Despite having the entire Divergent series ruined by the utter mind-rape that was Allegiant, which was in my opinion just a 526-page plot hole of nonsense, I decided to read the Four collection -- mainly because the e-book was available for free at my library and the other books I wanted to read weren't ready yet and I had time to kill. My conclusion after reading all of the short stories is. meh. Roth seems more capable of writing a boy who doesn't sound like a teenage girl when she isn't trying to write the girl character at the same time - I'm looking at you, Allegiant - but the writing style is still not all that different. As for the stories themselves, knowing the truth behind everything as revealed in Allegiant made it hard to care about anything or take any of it seriously, so I was forced to make a very conscious effort to block that book out of my mind (moreso than I already have) in order to just accept these stories for what they were in the ""original"" Divergent universe. And the stories were just okay. While we do learn some new details about Tobias's early Dauntless life and answer some unanswered questions, not much of it is all that interesting, and the last short story, which covers a good half of the plot from Divergent, is basically just fan fiction. All in all it was just. okay. Altogether the collection was a three-star read. There was nothing particularly offensive about it, but nothing all that interesting, either. If you must read it, borrow it from a friend or get it at the library. It's really not worth taking up permanent residence on your bookshelf or Kindle library. (Oh, and if you're going to buy it in e-book format, buy them separately. Amazon seems to be taking advantage of the fact that some people may not be observant/bright enough to notice that it's actually more expensive when you buy the bundle than if you just bought them for $1. 99 each."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

It serves the purpose, however, it has to be treated very gently, being careful not to break the plastic hinges or to have bottles flying around when pulling out the drawers.  Plastic bottles work better because they are not as heavy. The idea is good and would be better if it were made of metal."
Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I bought these to keep from talking to my neighbors. I walk the dog 6 days a week for exercise. I found if I walked during the day every annoying ass neighbor for 6 miles wants to talk to me. So, I bought these and listen to music while I walk. The noise isolation isn't extreme because I can still hear cars coming and my idiot neighbors calling my name. The cord is wicked long it's almost annoying. I got no cable wrap in the box like some other guy on here. They are big and stretch over my big melon head to completely cover my ears. Luckily they look huge so my neighbors can see I have them on and they don't think I'm ignoring them. They weigh nothing some idiots probably think that means they are cheaply made. They are quite well constructed. Get a pair you won't regret it."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"Beware if you are a parent of a younger child.  Not sure exactly who this is geared for?  Maybe older kids and adults very into dark steampunk-style?
We knew we were in trouble when one of the first scenes the mid-wife going to deliver Jack offered the mother whiskey?  This was originally a French movie that is dubbed in English and it is weird.  There are a lot of violent and bizarre scenes.  Very mild spoilers for examples: the midwife rips Jack's frozen heart out and replaces it with a cuckoo-clock?  Lots of bullying, including stabbing in the eye.  The songs are bizarre and very mature about intense love (Jack is not supposed to fall in love as one of his three rules to protect his cuckoo clock hearteveryone knows cuckoo clocks can't fall in love without breaking!  What?).  Again, steampunk fans who are teen and up may enjoy this.  As for us, while we appreciate the Tim Burton like darkness, the story was too bizarre and too violent for us and the kids had us turn it off after the second over the top song, really wish we hadn't purchased thisif you are not sure, may want to rent."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,CG,Nicely made but the one that broke was the one that was in the garage. I was just going to get one that worked but then I got the one that didn't. I used this to make a little makeshift bench outside in the yard.

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"this was a pretty good film. it was enjoyable. it tried to deal with a difficult topic-teenage sexuality and pregnancy. it was not heavy handed. it was good to see someone portray the reality of teens having unprotected sex and good to see Juno's friends and parents support this sweet and innocent girl. the teens were not condemned for their sexuality.  it doesn't deal with everything. there is often a huge down-side to teenage sex and pregnancy and many kids do choose abortion with its attendant pain and difficulties. the film does not deal with this. the film makes you think about your own values, experiences and relationships and that is good. it is not a comprehensive exploration but it is a good start. everyone has their own story and this is a good one. similar films which explore sexuality and dysfunctional relationships but are much better and deeper include American Beauty , Election, Rushmore, Harold and Maude and Secretary."

I recently met Dr. Lienhard at a book signing in which he graciously answered questions from an audience and took time to converse with buyers while autographing their purchases. Dr. Lienhard has the knack of bringing the scholar's intellect to the study of culture and technology without the slightest condescension. We briefly discussed Vermeer's use of the ""camera obscura"" which led to a brief exchange about the inevitability of ""photography"" and the ways in which it has, in turn, shaped our lives. A fascinating book from an engineer/philosopher."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"Multi author anthology - themed if you think the fact that both stories consist of 3 guys and 1 girl counts as a theme...  Let's be honest, it's a sexfest.  If that's what you're looking for, it delivers.

Pillow Talk  by Maya Banks starts out with the h/h [committed relationship] discussing their fantasies such as voyeurism and multiple partner sex.  Each decides to give the other their fantasies - which leads to some unforeseen complications; especially when they draw in other players...  WARNING:  this story contains fulfillment of a kidnap/forced sex fantasy - if this is an issue for you, stay away!  On the other hand, if you have hot firemen fantasies, this story is for you!

Her Fantasy Men by Shayla Black has the 3 heroes conspiring to get the heroine's attention - so she can choose them!  Most interesting to me was them trying to resolve their different loving styles - from the 'kisses and cuddles' guy to the 'tie them up and spank them' dominant.

Neither story contains male/male contact."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact. It's smaller, more powerful, and much nicer looking than my 13 year old microwave that we replaced."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far."

This is just my first impression of this particular car for anyone interested in getting one this size for the first time. When I first held the car in my hand I knew that this size scale was not for me at all. For the money it felt very cheap and the controller felt even worse. But that was okay because I was going to keep it anyways for fun around the house on a rainy day. that was until i charged up the battery, got everything hooked up, pulled the trigger. nothing. Apparently i got a bad controller because the car would only move after i pulled the trigger more than once forward and backwards to get it moving and once it did the car just took off and once it stopped same problem again. After about 10 minutes of this i gave up and sent it back. Like i said it just wasn't for me but that does not mean it's not for someone else. The cool thing about this car is that it's a hobby grade car which means you can upgrade it with metal parts and better upgrades if you wish. So if your willing to spend the money to do that then by all means buy the car and have fun with it."

Kindle_Store_5,2.0,OR,"Some may enjoy this overpriced series. I did not. These books are badly in need of an editor and a more interesting main character. Lexi Graves is shallow, often silly, and altogether a bit of a bore. Lexi also has a really hard time figuring out who the villain is until she has missed many of the clues, messed up the investigation, and gotten herself into a desperate situation that she then has to be rescued from.

Although the secondary characters are well-drawn, and the plots are interesting enough, the series as a whole does not justify the price.  I paid for the set, based on the good reviews, but I was having a difficult time reading past all the grammar mistakes and language oddities until I hit on the happy solution of bookmarking all the errors as if I were grading a paper.

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I bought two of these in September of 2012 - purchases were separated by 12 days. Well, one in my fathers Samsung Galaxy S2 died 10-15 days ago, and the one in my Samsung Galaxy S3 just died today, 2/20/2013. It seems they have a short life span - just 5 months, or I was just lucky enough to get 2 bad ones.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

I am giving it three stars because they worked just fine while they worked. I have a ticket opened with Sandisk as I am past the 90 day window with Amazon. I'll see how they respond, and if they will send me a replacement, and then I might update this review."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"Good concept, rainy day busy box/travel box, but my 9 year old got bored after about an hour and hasn't played with it since.
I was thrilled to see this item available because I loved the mystery activity books in my youth that would come with the special pen that uncovered the hidden messages.
My son was excited when I showed him he little brief case and it enticed him away from the tv and video games.  He sat engrossed in the activity books for about an hour, but said it became too redundant And boring.
He liked the red magnifying glass that revealed secret symbols to help him with the activities and the decoder pens.
The product is well packaged and  intriguing for kids to want to pick up to open (which is common with most Melissa and Doug products).
The age range for this toy is probably 7+. I'm disappointed as a parent because my child has not shown additional interest since the first day of opening this product. As I mentioned, I think it's a good concept at a good price point, but not sure if it's worth an hour of entertainment."

This particular set is in WHITE with a shiny finish featuring a vertical grooved pattern. I'm hoping the pattern will prevent denting. There is a protective clear plastic wrap encasing the set. Attached labels & Instructions are provided on how to reset the generic 000 lock code. This luggage genuinely exceeds my expectations. I first seen the Non-Prime HAUPTSTADTKOFFER Luggage set on Amazon and the 4 differences were it had a (1) matte finish, (2) Luggage front had the Company name on a silver metal plate (classy touch) & 3rd-it was priced approximately $70.00 more (or so). My main concern was the company didn't guarantee the 2 day shipping. However, this set is gorgeous, featuring expander zippers, 360 spinner wheels that keep spinning (quietly), zipper pockets/compartment on the L side & an elastic X strap securing the (R) compartment  for larger items. The handles flow easily up and down & the set is easy to maneuver, but still feels sturdy. I purchased Amazon fabric packing cubes in the same color pattern, White mesh with a Black zipper. It compresses your clothing & frees up valuable space. As I visualize the airline terminal staff tossing my luggage into the back of a transport vehicle & loading tons of luggage on the conveyer belt, I have a feeling these 3 pieces will survive the airport onslaught.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,CG,"I have spent considerable time reading the reviews and the instructions for how to make a dough dough, and I have found the best way to make a dough is to use a dough hook. The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good dough hook.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great. This is exactly what I was looking for. It is heavy and it doesn't have the wrinkles. It is very soft and nice looking.

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time."

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Ryder is still grieving the wife he loved and lost more than 4 years ago, but finds himself drawn to his best friend Tess in deeper ways; they are in love with each other, but don't want to risk ruining their friendship.

Best bits: Both Tess and Ryder had messed up birth parents, though Ryder was adopted into a loving home when he was 10 and Tess is still dealing with the aftermath of life with her crazy mother. Now, they both dedicate themselves to saving lives as EMTs. They're both good people, and both rather hung up on each other, though only Tess admits it to herself, and neither wants to mess up their friendship by being the first to move them towards romance. Definitely two very similar people, and once Ryder can get past his fear of losing someone he loves, they seem golden.

Issues: Plenty of typos and wrong words, as well as formatting errors with paragraph breaks happening where they shouldn't (especially in conversations, where it got really confusing as to who was talking at times) and not where they should. A handful of places where thoughts or memories really need to be set apart by italics. Not a fan of the ""quotes"" from characters that start each chapter (this time on separate pages before the chapters?). They feel forced and unnecessary. Some inconsistencies, like Tess's childhood first being described as constant movement from state to state as her mom switched boyfriends, but always after that she's described as having a hometown in NH that she was desperate to escape from."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"3.5 stars
This is skimpy set. When it is available and I can check it against the actual retail price I may update my rating. But otherwise meh. You only get round track, 3 cars, the controller and some removable decorations--it does have cool noises. I have a Marklin Z scale and an older O gauge by Lionel that I use during christmas time (obviously in different locations because near each other would be pure craziness) so I understand the train prices are more expensive than people realize, especially Engines. And this is a pretty neat and fun for little kids Engine. The Caboose is Bobber style and ok. The engine is a Lion chief Thomas the Tank and is very obviously the highlight of the set. The chirstmas hat makes it that much cuter. The remote is battery power and includes announcements and sounds but no smoke (that i could tell.) The middle freight car is nothing special and feels especially cheap, though to be fair these often do I think in part because of the open top design. The track diameter when fully spaced out is a little over 3 feet. The track is your standard Lionel rack and self stabilizes with the plastic base. With another car and 4-6 pieces of straight track this would be a neat 5 star set. As it is it just feels a little cheap. Lightweight, lots of plastic, not many cars and very small completed track.

I think most kids will love this set, and they can set it up themselves, and make train announcements--my nephew sure did--but I think parents need to understand what they're getting or they'll feel they maybe didn't get their money's worth. Its not quite the grand experience of trains of our youth. Its more plastic, less track, less cars, were bigger and we had to pay for it!"
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I originally got this for dog walking. It fits my massive iPhone 6+ in a Lifeproof case, headphones, doggy bags, and keys. Since its wider than most belts it's very roomy and I think I'm going to use it when traveling. A small money clip could hold cards and ID, leaving your valuables safe and your hands free. Kind of awesome, right?

During the day time I tend to use the black side out, but at night I turn it inside out so the pink is facing outwards. I put a couple of reflector stickers on it for extra visibility. Overall it's really well made. I can change my music through the touch screen, which is a nice feature that I can't do without now lol. The zipper is very sturdy and it doesn't slip at all during use. I've washed it a few times since I get it sweaty and there hasn't been any pilling or fading. Really happy with it. :)

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,5.0,OR,"As you can see from the photo, this bra is nothing special as far as looks go. It's not the bra that I would wear under my t-shirts when I'm out and about (because it doesn't flatter me as much as my favorite underwires), but it's great for giving me much-needed support when I'm home taking it easy and it's a great value for the price. A lot of women prefer to go braless at home, but, if you're like me and want/need support during all waking hours, this may very well be the bra for you. The wide under-band doesn't provide as much support as my Bali underwires but I found it to be adequate. I guess you can say that it strikes a happy medium between industrial strength support and going braless. I ordered this bra at the lower end of my regular band size - in other words, I generally wear a 38 or a 40 so I chose the 38 - because I figured that it should fit snug in order to be supportive. Once I got the bra and tried it on, I was glad I ordered that way because I'm sure it's going to stretch out a bit over time and, by ordering snug, I'll get better support for a longer period of time. I ordered it in my regular cup size and that worked out fine. The shoulder straps are comfortable and the hooks are strong and secure. I don't usually order bras online unless I am already familiar with the fit, but I went into this purchase with the idea that it was going to function as a house bra and I was not too concerned with how it looks; I just wanted one that doesn't have wires and feels nice and comfortable with just enough support.

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Peggy Henderson's Blemished Brides series just keeps getting better and better; In His Arms is my favourite by far. Levi and Grace have both had difficult things to deal with in the past which have left them both reluctant to trust or let anyone get close to them. Thrown together in unusual circumstances, this is the story of two people who find their walls breaking down and that trust and love are possible. In my opinion this book contains Peggy's most beautiful writing to date. The characters are realistic and well-drawn as always. Grace is a determined and stubborn person, despite (or maybe because of) the circumstances that have surrounded her life. She also has a softness to her, and I was on her side right from the beginning. Levi is a self-sufficient but thoroughly sweet and gentlemanly man. I was also very much on his side from the beginning! Together they make the perfect couple, and seeing them happy at the end of the book was extremely satisfying. The supporting characters are great (I won't say more as I don't want to give anything away), and, as usual, the natural world, which Peggy describes so well, is very much in evidence. If I could I would give this book more than 5 stars."
Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"I've had 4 of these speakers hooked up to an Acoustic Research center channel and subwoofer as a complete 5.1 system.  These speakers have very nice and clear sounds.  In the past, I've had the Bose, Acoustic Research, and Klipsch Quintet III 5.1 systems, and these Energy Takes actually produce the best sound quality out of all of them.  For some reason, I'd like to replace speakers once every 3 years or so to sample their sounds, as some do it with cars.  It's hard to describe the sound quality as opposed to be heard to experience.  But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.  Of course, none of them could come close to my top-of-the-line JBL tower speakers, but those are tower speakers and they cost $4000 (even 10 years ago)."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"Update:  I received the 600 Professional today.  First off,  this filter is very large.  It completely dwarfs both my Fluval 305 and
Marineland 350 Magnum.

I also notice that like my Fluval 305,  the Hydor is manufactured in Italy.  Something I find interesting,  given all of the aquarium
filters that are made in China.

The 600 PRO is well  constructed,  with five media baskets:  two for mechanical filtration and three for biological filtration.

The motor housing for this filter is solid and well designed, and the motor itself  is completely silent.

The motor head is secured to the 600 PRO's canister  with front and back clamps, as well as side levers which offer
a tighter seal.

Even the media trays have nice adjustable plastic straps which allow for easy removal of media, and the trays themselves fit snugly into the 600 PRO's chassis, stacked atop one another.

Aesthetically,  the entire  Hydor Professional series has a refreshingly industrial look,  which exudes quality.

The fact that this filter was discounted by about $80 from its list price only makes the aforesaid that much better.

If the Hydor 600 PRO stands up as well as my Fluval 305 and  Eheim Classic filters have, I will consider this to be money well spent.

Highly recommended!

I have been considering purchasing one of these filters since they came out.  However, they were selling at list price for quite awhile.
So I decided to wait  until the prices became more reasonable.  I just found a brand new 600 for sale on Amazon for about $150, so I decided to purchase it.  Will update my experiences.  Based on what I have read about these filters thus far, I've left four stars.

This is the largest canister filter I have ever purchased.  I also own a Marineland Magnum 350 and a pair of Fluval 305s (350 GPH VS 260 GPH respectively), so at 345 GPH this will be about as large as the Magnum 350, even though the 600 dwarfs the 350 in size."

I knock softly three times; wait for two seconds and then twice again. The spy hole immediately opens and I can feel myself being visibly searched from my head to my toes. I see the eyes catch a glimpse of my Three Wolf Moon Tee shirt and then just the barest of a smile. Seconds later, I hear the sound of several dead bolts being released and I am welcomed into a vibrant room full of beautiful people. Led to my table by a beautifully tantalizing Oriental woman wearing a thigh high cut dress, I am immediately set upon by servants trying to catch a glimpse of my famously designed shirt. I cannot begin to believe my good fortune at just being admitted into the famous Che Le Torche Cabaret in Algiers. No questions asked, no cards required...Just service with a smile and almost a sense of reverence or perhaps I should say... awe. I am on my second straight tequila, when I sense the presence of someone standing at the edge of my table. A tall thin man in a while silk suit wearing a Panama hat wordlessly hands me a card with just one word on it.. ""Omar"". He asks if he might join me. I quickly judge this is a man to be reckoned with after noticing the long scar running from the edge of his mouth to his right ear.

""Why not? I reply.

Before the evening is finished I will have found not a friend, but a new business partner, who is destined to make me a very rich man.

The reason for my success?

Simple... Omar tells me that he could determine I was a man to be trusted and that he could rely upon because of my discriminating taste by owning and actually wearing a Three Wolf Moon tee shirt in public.

Life is very strange."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,3.0,OR,"The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"I used one of these on a build I did for a friend and was very impressed with the quality. It was matched with a Vortex Strike Eagle 1-8. A quality mount is important as the best optic is useless if you match it to junk rings. That said I didn't want to spend as much on the mount as I did on the mount and had read good things about this mount. The rings are uniquely hinged. The mount itself is well machined and very light weight. Aero has gather a good reputation for itself by making good quality items at fair prices and this mount is exactly that.

There are a few things to be aware of. Because of the way the rings are made the scope has a tendency to turn in the rings when they are tightened. You can try to compensate for that. Or you can apply a light coat of oil to the ring/scope allowing them to move. The second is that because the mount is aluminum and the screws are steel you need to be very careful with your torque. The mount comes with a allen wrench and instructions which I recommend you follow carefully and you will have no issues. Do no over tighten as it is easy to strip the aluminum threads. All in all this is a fantastic mount for a very good price and a great optic for an ultra light build."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup."

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"OK, so Fisher-Price isn't the same as it was when YOU were a kid.
Newsflash!
Neither are today's kids.

I understand that people are sceptical of tie-ins with movies, but that at least is familiar to all of us. That has always been around.

I think the biggest complaint for the Imaginext line for me, which I DO have, myself, is the quality for the price. The plastic is not as high quality as it should be.

However, I disagree on a different point with a number of the other reviewers here.

I am talking about the ""boredom factor"" mentioned. It seems to plague many of the parents or reviewers.

I have one question. I do not mean to offend people, just to make them think.

Take a 6 year old, for example (not a 3 year old--this toy is recommended for 36 months to age 8!!!-- unless the 36 month old in question is a card carrying member of MENSA), and try opening this WITH him or her ... and playing with it TOGETHER!

It is kind of similar to learning to read a book, when you learn to play. You need guidance. Ages 4-6 (which I figure are the most appropriate for the Imaginext DC Super Friends Superman Playset) are still encompassing fairly young children.
Reading to a child in that age range makes books something which will then be loved far more than if a child just looks at books by him or her self.

It is the same thing with a toy like this. Don't expect a toy to be a babysitter.

Play with your child when you offer your child the toy.

There is lots to do with it! We like it very much.
I hope you understand that I am not dissing everyone who called it boring.
I am just providing a different perspective. Thanks for reading!
Mom of five sons here! :)

Quick read - alternating points of view
Let me start off by saying the story itself was ok. There were a few errors that were distracting/confusing. The reason why Robyn was kicked out at age 15. The whole family dynamics was off. There story in the beginning of the book was not what was revealed at the end. the relationship between Garrick and Robyn pretty much happened over night. Robyn was very independent and she worked hard to pay her bills and finance her degree. Garrick wanted to take care and protect her. He was possessive and bossy. They clashed a lot. But the make ups were hot and sexy.
There was a lot of drama in a short period of time. Robyn became a magnet for trouble. Near rapes, stalkerish ex, drug dealers etc. Everything wrapped up nice and neat in the end."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,CG,"As others have noted, in this movie, the movie is set in a world that is not just a closed society but a world where most people have no basic rights, so it is not surprising that many people in the movie are in a position to enjoy the movie.  There are many people who have no rights because they do not have a basic right and are in a situation where they are forced to live with the consequences of their actions.  In this case, the movie is based on the book of the same name by the late writer William Wordsworth.  Wordsworth is famous for his work, and he wrote many great novels, including his famous ""The Tempest.""  Wordsworth's novel was inspired by the book of the same name and was the inspiration for the movie.

The movie also features some of the very best actors in the movie.  The film is directed by William Shakespeare and the cast is great.  I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and a good acting performance.

The movie was made in the mid-1950s by John Henry Ewing, who was a large, well-known actor in Hollywood.  Henry Ewing was the son of the legendary actor William Ewing and was born in England in 1885.  Henry Ewing's father was a big comic actor who played a major role in the movie.  He was known as a hard-bitten and gruff man, but his father's character was very sympathetic and kind.  Henry Ewing's father was very good at sports, but his mother was a bit too shy and a bit too violent.  In the movie, Ewing is a bit of a troublemaker who"

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable."

The only issue I have is that it is not as bright as the old one.  I put it in a dimmer, and it is still dim, but it is only about 10 watts.  I would be much happier if it was a little brighter.  It would be better if it was a little brighter.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"This is a very good book that deals with problems a lot of kids have, such as being picked on and left out, even if the main focus was fantasy.  Being an avid reader of fantasy, I have read all the old cleshaes, but this book was in a league all it's own.  The story is about thirteen year old Nita, who goes into a library to hide from bullies, and comes across a training book on  how to be a wizard.  After reading through it, she discovers that she has many of the qualifications, so she decides to give it a shot, though she suspects some sort of prank.  In her exploriations, she meets up with Kit, a twelve year old boy in basicly the same situation as her, and they decide to team up and  be partner wizards.  As I read this book, I found myself likeing it more and more, as I enjoyed the sense of magic, and identified  strongly with the main character.

There is one thing that should be pointed out - when you test the ""keyless"" lock operation, it gives you a few seconds to change your mind before actually engaging the lock - so when you install this and then test out that feature, it can seem as though the lock is not locking if you IMMEDIATELY turn it back to ""test"" it - you have to lock, then wait a couple of seconds."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,4.0,OR,"I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading."

I didn't get the sense of completely knowing Rosemarie since a lot of the chapters from her perspective were general narration. That being said, this was a very short book and I think sacrificing getting to know some of the characters deeper was a reasonable tradeoff for a light quick read. Who should read it? Folks looking for a quick happily ever after. Please note: I received a free copy of this book in exchange of an honest review courtesy of the publisher. See all my reviews and more at www.

Home_and_Kitchen_5,5.0,CG,My kiddo and I fight over what I want to do with it.
Books_5,4.0,CG,"We were introduced to the characters of the book and they all came together for a very satisfying story.

I had to say, ""Okay, I'm not going to say it's a cliffhanger. Just because I'm on a cliffhanger doesn't mean I have to say it's a cliffhanger. I'm going to say it's a cliffhanger because I just want to get to the end of the book and I don't want to go back to it. I don't want to be around forever. I want to go back to the past.""

I found the book to be very well written and the characters well developed. I found the story of the two main characters interesting and the plot of the story to be very realistic. I found it very interesting to watch their interactions as they made their decisions and how they changed in the past.

I enjoyed the book a lot and I thought the author did a good job of setting the mood of the book and the story. I was very disappointed with the ending of the book. I was hoping for a more more ""realistic"" ending and was disappointed in the ending. I hope that the author doesn't change the ending of the book. I think that is a good thing.

Overall, I enjoyed the book"
Pet_Supplies_5,4.0,OR,"If you want the convenience of buying puppy training pads in bulk and want a great price this is a great choice. These Wee Wee brand pads are by Four Paws, the same company that makes the better quality pads sold at Petco and the other big box stores.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory."

Electronics_5,4.0,OR,"I put in a 200-a Square D ""QO"" panelboard when it was time to upgrade, and figured why not put this surgebreaker in at the time, I had slots open and it seemed like a good idea since the house is in rural countryside and has flakey power.
A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"I've had the chance to read quite a few books that provide guidance and examples of how to become a better professional designer. After reading David Berman's most book Do Good Design, I find myself to be enlightened and newly aware of the social influence and ethical accountability of visual design.

David states that technology has turned the world into designers via personalized interfaces, computers, and cell phones which segues into the his core thoughts:

- Designers have more power than they realize
- The largest threat to humanity's future just may be the consumption of more than necessary
- Human civilization...can not afford one more major global goof
- The same design that fuels mass overconsumption also holds the power to repair the world
- We live in an unprecedented technological age where we can each reach a larger legacy by propagating our best ideas than by propagating our chromosomes
- Designers can be a model for other professions for identifying ones' sphere of influence, and then embrace the responsibility that accompanies the power to help repair the world
- Don't just do good design, do good

While I won't list all of the book's chapters (Amazon already has a TOC link), I'll highlight a memorable quote from each major section:

- The Creative Brief: Disarming Weapons of Mass Deception
""Designers can use their professional power, persuasive skills, and wisdom to help distribute ideas the world really needs""

- The Design Solution: Convenient Truths
""Imagine again a society's potential where the largest signs, the cleverest ads, the most prominent messages promote healthy behaviors....We can choose it now.""

- The Do Good Pledge
Immediacy - The time to commit is now
Ethics - I will be true to my profession
Principles - I will be true to myself
Effort - I will spend at least 10 percent of my professional time helping repair the world

I don't think I ever took notice of the magnitude of ads / visual lies that were around me before I read David's book. I HIGHLY recommend this book and I hope that once people read it, we can start showing the truth altogether."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,1.0,OR,"Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

Toys_and_Games_5,4.0,OR,"My one year-old son totally loves his other Oball trucks, but I admit that I was a little unsure about this one -- I really didn't think that he would figure out how it works, and I wasn't sure that it would be as ""fun"" as a dump truck or bulldozer. Well, I unpacked it from the frustrating packaging one night and left it on the floor, and the next morning he found it while I was making breakfast. By the time I came over to see what he was doing, he was opening the sides up and taking he cars out, stacking other things in there, closing it up again, and running the truck around. There's even a little ramp that comes down the back for the cars to come down from.

The only downside for me on this one is that the design seems a little more finicky than most toys we use at this age. When you're closing either one of the sides of the carrier or the ramp, their are bits on either end of it that need to snap in. To get both, you either need to realize that you need to push in on both edges of the ramp and on both ends of the each of the flap down sides, or you need to apply pressure pretty exactly in the middle -- so with a young child, it's super common for just one end to snap in and the other end to still be unlatched, which in this house sometimes means that the doors flop back open when you hit a bump. It's not the end of the world, and I'm sure he'll figure it out as he gets a bit older -- but it's occasionally frustrating for him now."

Books_5,3.0,OR,"This is a fascinating, if slight, tale about one part of the massive Oxford English dictionary's creation. Basically, the story recounts how a paranoid bi-polar man helped write and research a huge portion of the world largest dictionary.

Along the way we get fascinating peeks into the creation of the OED, Victorian and Edwardian views on mental health and quite a few other asides.
I am not sure that this is a book so much as a long magazine article (think New Yorker style). Occasionally it seems that Winchester overuses foreshadowing and previewing to ""fluff"" the work up into book length. At one point he mentions that the event he was going to talk about was the most important even in the 20th century. What he does talk about next is very interesting, but he offers no clue as to how, even in the context of the story, the event was ""the most important event."" Hyperbole like that is strewn throughout the book and does not need to be. This story is fascinating on its own.

A 1977 review of Eraserhead by Variety called it a ""sickening bad-taste exercise"" which ""pulls out all gory stops in the unwatchable climax....the mind boggles to learn that Lynch labored on this pic for five years"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,3.0,OR,"Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts."

They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her.

Another added benefit for me was the fact that the book is 100+ pages- not too long and not too short. It gives you enough tips and tricks without stuffing your head with unnecessary facts and info.

The workouts were very easy to follow and the photographs really helped me to get a better idea of how to do the moves. I found this to be an absolutely fantastic book for kettle bell training and would recommend it to others without hesitation."

Movies_and_TV_5,2.0,OR,"You know, I've been a fan of these Paranormal Activity movies since it debuted a few years ago. The first and second movies were pretty decent, although you can tell they were made on a low-budget. The first two relied more on getting to know the characters and heavily on very slow-building tension, which is why I loved them so much. That makes me wonder why this one just went off-track. PA3 is, quite literally, a weak mess of a movie. You'd think these guys would up the wow factor of this movie, considering how the first two were, but no. I know they were trying to tell the backstory to the series but they could do that and still wow us. The acting was very dry and that made it unbelievable to me. I mean, the knockoff movie:Paranormal Entity, was way better than this one. I was really disappointed and just can't recommend anyone buy this movie. If you can find it in a bargain bin somewheres, okay-maybe then. But for full asking price-No. These guys better get their game on in the next movie or fans are going to jump ship, plain and simple."
Books_5,4.0,OR,"I quite enjoyed this book, and not just because I like food, or am a fan of Ramsay (I confess to both). As a small shop owner, I found much information in this book useful even though I am not a restauranteur, and have referred to it often over the past year and some months I've had it. I recommend it to anyone who is either thinking of starting a business, or who feels their business is in a bit of a rut. I can't say you will find direct examples, but if you keep your mind open you'll see the larger points he is making re: business. It has helped me do a great deal of brainstorming about the fundamentals of my business, including challenging my own biases and preconceptions about my shop.

The only reason my review is not 5 stars is that it does repeat itself a bit at the end. This is also the fault of a great many business books, most of which do this to a much greater degree."

The actors Vittorio de Sica, Gina Lollobrigida and Marisa Merlini played in both movies and the product description could easily be related to any of them.

It's heavy duty and well made-should last for years.

It's not perfect, though. The handles are bulkier than the Swing-Away.

Bianca is the young and beautiful dancer who works at the Grand. While working there , she sees a handsome bouncer, whose name is West. She really likes West and would love to get to know him better but thinks she is beneath him, that she is no good for him
One day her mom shows up and tells her that her dad is in trouble, the mob is after him and they needs a lot of $$$$$$ to get him out of it or things will get real bad, real soon. Bianca decides she has no choice but to rob the Grand. Its not like, as she sees it, shes rolling in the money. West, whom she has been slowly talking to, sees she is in trouble and wants to help but knows she won't say a word, keeps wait, watches and hopes she will say something. The attraction, the chemistry between these two are some explosive and electric. Will they or won't they is the question. And will West still want Bianca when all is said and done. Their love story is so beautiful and so full of emotion. There is a lot of pain built into this story. And there is darkness in this story. I loved reading it, feeling it as I read and it kept me on my toes which is Im sure what the characters felt. We see and can feel the human frailties in this story and also can feel the pain yet the hope and that is something Skye Warren does really well. I love how West wants to protect Bianca and does this sweet , alpha man act really well and oh my gawd, it did it soooooooooo well. I want a man like this. Bianca was so worried she would lose him but the ending will show us the HEA. I cannot wait for the next book in the series!

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"My first comment is that these dolls are for children over the age of 10 and/or adult collectors.  These dolls have extremely small parts including hands and arms that have to be detached to undress/redress them.  Their limbs can be fragile as well and are easily snapped at the joints if they are played with too roughly.

Past that, I have nothing but praise for these highly detailed beauties!  I love the accessories they come with including highly detailed shoes, purses, jewelry, and clothing.  Their faces are gorgeous, and with the diaries and info on the boxes kids can really get to know the doll and her personality.  Overall a creative new doll line that encourages kids to accept all kinds of ""creatures"" no matter their background.  They promote the message of tolerance in a pretty package."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

Electronics_5,3.0,OR,"I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.

Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"This is a remarkable documentary, not for any other reason than it's indomitably spirited lead.  Yes, Tammy Faye is a cartoon, a travesty of taste (on the dvd it is easy to focus on her fashion, we kept going back to some sort of hat that looked like she was a huge, religious, heavily made up insect....antennae and all.)  But like all good documentaries, it respects it's subject in a way that you come from it with much love and appreciation.  The dvd has no special stuff but the documentary alone has enough for cult viewers, pop culturists and voyeurs to obsess over for months.  There are puppets(religious puppets that they formed from porky pig heads), there is Jesus as Joy, lots of singing, Jerry Falwell(if you never hated him before, you will now) riding down a water slide, narration by a sedated RuPaul...but under all the incredible tack, Tammy Faye emerges as an amazingly passionate, forgiving non judgemental human being.  Her stand considering gay christians and christians with aids is almost revolutionary.  .......also there is a speech she gives at the end, when doing a sermon, which is inspired and forgiving.  It gives you a very different perspective on the permanantly made up miracle maven......This is a documentary that stays with you, respectful, kitschy(love the jim j and tammy faye show), informative and at times confrontative, this is a really fun watch.  You will end up liking Tammy Faye a little more than you expected..."

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,4.0,OR,"Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on."
Movies_and_TV_5,5.0,OR,"As a young child I saw this movie in the theater and I have never forgotten it.  It has seldom been shown but I never forgot how wonderful an experience of life and adventure it was.  The cast was perfect and kept largely to the novel.  Lana Turner, Donna Reed, Edmund Gwen were perfect in their roles.  For its time this movie was far ahead with the special effects and photography.  I recommend this film to those who still believe of the courage of youth and the joy of reconciliation as older people.  I just can't recommend this film enough."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure the 16 movie version is not legit.  The DVD menus are just a still image.  There is absolutely no copy write information on anything or any warnings...  Each dvd just has a still image with the list of movies at the bottom to select.  I noticed the audio cutting in and out and switching from 5.1 or stereo while watching it, this only happened a few times.  The quality seems to be normal for dvd's.  Keep in mind that everything will look fuzzy on a large HD tv, but that is normal.

That said, I got this for like 30 bucks, and that is an amazing deal considering that these movies are sooo ridiculously overpriced individually.  The Blu Ray version of these movies go for 30-40+ dollars a piece, which is total BS in my opinion.  I definitely recommend this, but don't spend 1 or 200 bucks on this like some people are saying, there are plenty of 30ish dollar copies out there if you look.  There are several listings for this on amazon, do a more general search if you can't find them."

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"The leg holes were a bit small for my 8mo who is big for his age (21lbs / 28 inches) in comparison to the body hole which is twice his size. The result is that baby was nervous wobbling back and forth in the beginning. Once we showed the baby to lean forward, he seemed to take it better and wasn't as scared. Making the leg holes even 1 inch bigger would be great, and make the body hole 4 inches smaller in circumference would balance this out better.
For direct overhead shade, this shade stands up but wobbles. Perhaps an extra snap button loop towards the front and next to the existing ones would give it more stability. Overall, for the price, durability, and value. We are happy. Also nice to have something baby that is NOT so bulky while porting everything else around."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness."

I discovered this the hard way in an airsoft game. The flashlight is at a good brightness as well. I would hazard something above 150 lumens, although this figure should not be quoted. It comes with a pressure switch as well, although I have no idea where I'm gonna place mine. Not the easiest device to operate if you don't have the pressure switch though. The laser proved to be an excellent intimidation tactic at the game, though, so I will definitely be bringing it on more of them. Shame about the battery, though. Not the most common batteries to be found, so I'll be a little bit of a pickle once mine run out.

You'll have to apply the stickers on yourself, though. This is not a difficult task, however."

 The router set-up is easy if you are familiar with routers. However, do not rely on the wizard provided and be prepared to set it up manually. I will not fault D-link to much for that, as in my experience automatic router setup programs from Linksys and Netgear did not work any better either.

Make sure you upgrade firmware immediately to the latest available. It now remains to be seen how long this router will stay working. So far, I have no reason to regret buying it."

Home_and_Kitchen_5,4.0,OR,"Most of the reviews I've read here below 2 stars are failing to treat this blender with care. If you are making smoothies, make sure you do the following:

1) Always put liquid like nectar into the cup FIRST - very important. It should be at least 1/3 of the contents.
2) Don't stick large pieces of fruit into the container. Cut them up into 1"" or less cubes. This will make it easier to blend.
3) Do not put large ice cubes in the container. It will get stuck between the container and the blades. The blades are not big. If you push your luck too far and hit the blender button, the ice cubes will get stuck. You can burn out the motor that way, let alone break the container.
4) Do not fill the container more than 75% of the contents. That will prevent any explosion and leaking.
5) Do not press the button for long durations. Do quick presses to let the contents move around and displace itself. If you get ice cubes stuck and continue to press, you will burn out the motor.
6) Always lock the cup into the base. It is really easy to just shove it in the base and hit the button. Don't. There are icons on the cup that align with the base. Use them to avoid problems.
7) Watch the contents in the cup. If they are stuck and not moving, stop pressing the button. Take those items out and cut them into smaller sizes.
8) You will know you are pushing your luck too far when you start to smell an odor coming from the unit. Stop blending and let the motor cool down.

I've made many smoothies this way and they turn out pretty good. But just don't expect professional quality because the blades and motor are nowhere near a professional/commercial quality blender."

The tools are... okay. Actually, I LOVE the crevice tool. However, I found the dusting tool effective only for moving cat fur around without sucking it up. The upholstery tool worked okay, but when I took the removable piece off to empty dust out, it seemed impossible to put together again without breaking the plastic parts. I managed to pop it back into place, but then it wouldn't spin. Just too much of a pain; I ended up attempting tools from a previous vac.
Oh yes, and the retractable cord does not work on my vac. That is a bummer; but overall I still like the product."

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"The Garmin ""Bluecharts"" are vector charts, which means they use mathematic algorithms to store all the lines and features of a nautical chart.  I have steered away from these in the past because they tended to give up a lot of detail vs. ""Raster Graphic"" charts, which are essentially photographic images of paper charts.
With ""Bluecharts"" they have gotten to a level of detail (including multiple colors) that they look almost as good as a paper charts.  The advantages of vector charts is that they take up much less room on your hard drive and run much faster on a PC.  This is important when you are zooming in and out to see your depth or proximity to a wreck while moving on a boat.
I use mine with an eTrex Legend and am able to load most of the detail (depth, obstructions, nautical aids, etc) onto the handheld.  For the full look of charts, I connect the GPS unit to my laptop.  The package also includes tidal charts, which are much more detailed and accurate than the little tide chart booklets I used to use. Overall, it makes navigation a breeze...your boat is automatically represented on the chart and you have many simple tools to calculate distance/time to a given destination.  It also incorporates additional information on Marinas and service locations.
The Garmin application the charts run on, ""MapSource"" allows you to easily switch between map types.  I have ""Americas Bluechart,"" ""MetroGuide"" (streetmaps), and ""Tides and Marine Services,"" all without having to reconnnect the GPS unit.
The only hassle is the ""Unlock"" process, which is a bit time consuming and involves providing the Garmin website with a bunch of codes, including the serial number of my GPS unit to unlock a set of charts from the CD-ROM.  I'm not sure, but I think it will only work with that specific unit, which worries me a bit as I am thinking about buying a second unit for backup."

I needed something that would stop that behavior, and this worked well.  It only took a few times of using it, and now I can just show them the can, and they'll stop.

I really didn't expect this book to be as good as it was, but I was pretty disappointed.  The story is very boring.  The characters are not interesting.  There is nothing to interest me.

This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is a sweeping family saga set during the Dublin Easter uprising and the First World War. The Carmodys are a well to do Irish family living a charmed life in Dublin. Tragic events following the 1916 Easter uprising sees the family at odds with each other and forced to move to London.
Young firebrand Danny is supporting the cause of an independent Ireland. This puts him at odds with his brother Patrick who decides to join the Royal navy. Jenny his spoiled sister finds herself penniless and forced to look for work. Her Fiance John, once a promising prospect, is arrested for his involvement in the uprising and imprisoned.
This book is meticulously researched and contains many period details that bring the story alive. The working conditions for the women in the munitions factories and the horrors of the battlefield are a brutal back ground that helped me feel a great deal of compassion for the family.
I especially liked the character of Jenny as she undergoes a complete transformation. She starts of as a spoiled and selfish girl, but through hardship her eyes gradually open and we see her grow into a confident, independent and intelligent young woman. The story ends in 1917 and as this is titled book 1, I hope that Ms Petken is already busy writing the follow up. There are turbulent times ahead for Ireland and Im sure well see Danny involved. I look forwards to reading the follow up as this writer has a very engaging style and her research is solid."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Brash Books likes to revive old classics. Hit and Run was first published in 1989, so our heroine, Delilah, has to work this case the old fashioned waywithout the internet or even a cell phone. She doesnt actually witness the Trans Am mowing down the elderly man; she hears tires squealing and a thud while pulling herself up from where she landed when the car climbed the curb and she dove for safety. Then, she found the body of Joseph Collins in the street while limping to a telephone booth trying to figure out who to call for a ride. So when the teenage driver, Michael Moraless mother swears the old man was already lying dead in the street, and Mike did not realize hed even hit a human being, Delilah agrees to think about taking the case. And thats when things start to get really weird.

The janitor in Delilahs office building (where shes living, hoping business will pick up) is a would-be sleuth named Harry Polk who is thrilled to have a real PI in the place. Her self-appointed assistant, he gets beaten up by someone who doesnt want her to pursue her investigation. Charlie Colfax, a friend of her late husband, shows up frequently, offering her various jobs, trying to get her to close her office and work for him.

Hit and Run sucked me in on the first page and didn't spit me out until the end. I liked Delilah and the people around her. The only glitch I found was a tendency to use adjectives when Ms. OCallaghan should have used adverbs, a trend I see about as often as comma splices which were blessedly missing from this book. The characters were well drawn, and the dialogue was natural. Delilah West is the forerunner and role model for such female sleuths as V.I. Warshawski and Stephanie Plum, and she sets the bar pretty high. Grab Hit and Run while you can, and see how it all started."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"I don't know why I chose this book as the first book of Cole McCade to read but I am so glad that I did. This book is not for the faint of heart. It has strong elements of abuse and was very dark at times but still beautifully written. Poetic, lyrical, yet dark and gritty, raw and full of emotion. Leigh is an amazing young woman. She is strong yet broken, fragile and dangerously damaged. There were times that it was hard to read because she felt that she deserved what had been done to her. So as you hear in so many instances of abuse she continued to be abused (we read in great detail much of the abuse) and yet we see her grow stronger as the book continues until she finally decides that she will no longer be the victim and to finally fight for what she knows she deserves. The beautiful Gabriel is also broken but he is broken because of his choices to not feel the pain that was inflicted upon him by war. Gabriel sees the brokenness in Leigh and yet from the first time he meets he, he is drawn to her. There were just so many elements of this story that kept me reading it and not the least of which is Cole's ability to draw you into an emotional level with each character in the story, feel their pain (I have since learned that he does this because he has experienced it) and finally experience the freedom of love. Even with the rawness and grittiness, Cole turned this story into one of beauty. It is also evident that Cole is a great lover of books because there are ALOT of references to books, both subtly and not but he weaves them into the story beautifully. Even his acknowledgements were touching. Cole is definitely an author I will be following and reading and could there possibly be another story in the Crow City, fingers crossed!!"
Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,OR,"This 2000 Israeli film is as fresh as today's headlines.  Set in a settlement in Israel it's about a radical rabbi and his ardent followers, two best friends who compete for the rabbi's daughter, and the ongoing conflicts of orthodoxy and secularism in Israel.

The film is as bleak as the landscape around the settlement.  And the rabbi's radicalism is the one thing that keeps the young men bound together.  One of them is in the army and creates a religious unit much to the concern of his superiors who distrust the radicalism, even though the soldiers perform well.  Another young man is the scholar and the rabbi wants him to marry his daughter.  Alas, though, she prefers the soldier.  Trouble follows.  She leaves the settlement and goes to the city where she finds an apartment with some other religious young women.

Her rejection of her religious suitor, however, pushes him to plan to commit a radical act and he involves the soldier as well as another innocent friend in the plan.  How this all plays out is scary, as we are all aware of the potential violence of terrorist attacks.  This film brings this all out as well as some complex psychological factors.

The problem was that the story moved a little two slowly for my taste.  Also, as it was a foreign film, I know that it lost a lot in translation.  It seemed as if some parts were missing and the narrative seemed to jump round awkwardly.  So, in spite of its message and the tension raised regarding what would happen next, I found myself looking at the clock and feeling bored.  However, the film had an interesting theme and the acting was excellent.  It also showed me the world through a unique point of view."
Books_5,5.0,OR,"DEEP BLUE ALIBI by Paul Levine is a winner all around.  The mystery investigation and court scenes are intellectually stimulating and correct with a real ""got chya"" factor.  The humor between the characters is sophisticated and down right raunchy at times, but wonderful to come across as the book unfolds. The relationship between Steve Solomon (who is as clever and smart as the Bible's King Solomon, who decides to offer to divide a baby in half in order to find it's real mother) and Victoria Lord (whose brains, beauty, and emotional issues would via for Dr. Phil status with any God) are perfect characters to keep the mystery alive. Then add in [...] Bobbie, live-in nephew of Solomon whose ""savant"" traits make for more humor and interesting discoveries of facts for the reader. This book is an easy sell.

Kindle_Store_5,3.0,OR,"Even after thinking on it a while after I finished reading, I still have mixed feelings about this book.  The characters were likable, especially Cade, but there were parts of the story that just didn't work for me.  The main thing was some of the dialogue between Cade and Brook.  I hate to say it, but it was juvenile at times, and very repetitive.

As I said, I liked Cade.  I really felt bad for him, and the way he seemed to be led on my Brook, and just waiting around for her to make a decision that would effect their possible future together.  I did start liking the book more at the end, and was rooting for Cade and Brook to finally get their HEA.

The book was long, and not being completely invested in the story until close to the end, it took me longer than usual to read, so to get to the end and see that there would be another book?  I was pretty disappointed.  I still can't decide if I liked the story enough to want to see what happens next."

Books_5,5.0,OR,"Nine years ago, Alex Delaware successfully treated Melissa Dickinson, a tormented and phobic young girl, irrationally scared of almost everything. After two years of treatment, Melissa seems almost totally recovered, so her need for Dr Delaware ceases, and she becomes one of his most spectacular triumphs. Now, Melissa contacts Alex again, this time seeking advice concerning her mother. Gina Dickinson is a recluse, an ex-actress hiding away from the world ever since a vicious acid attack that left her scarred for life, even after extensive and traumatic plastic surgery. Even though Gina is now seeing, with some effect, a psychiatrist of her own, Melissa wants to know if Alex feels her mother could cope if she went away, accepting her place Harvard. Then, one day, Gina inexplicably climbs into her car, and drives off into thin air, leaving a tangled mystery to be unravelled in her wake.
I had started to think that this series was in danger of going stale. The prose is adequate and easy to read, but hardly full of spirit and at times seems a little perfunctory, and Alex Delaware has also remained a rather static - if very likeable - character. But now, after reading Kellerman's excellent standalone ""The Butcher's Theatre"", I returned to the series with ""Private Eyes"", and found it a wonderfully invigorating experience. This may be his lone of his longest Delaware books to date, but every word is fascinating, and there seems to me to be fresh fire in the writing. The characters are all very well developed, and although Kellerman never really takes any risks with his well-structured plot, it's a complex and clever book that really kicks the brain into gear, and presents one or two nice surprises along the way.
The psychology is dead-on, the relationships are all fascinating, the characterisation is acute, and the resolution is exciting, well-done, and satisfying. This may well turn out to be the rock of the Delaware series. To find out, i shall have to read on..."

Oliver Stone brought Alexander and his times to life for me, and Colin Farrell did an excellent job putting a human face on a man who thought he was a god.  Don't be put off by the jabs of spoiled movie critics - watch this lavish and engrossing film, and enjoy!

The only flaw I saw with the film - and it may be an insurmountable one - is that so much went on in Alexander's life, that it is probably impossible to present it all in a single movie.  Stone gives us a glimpse into the political, military, and personal aspects of Alexander's story, and these really can't be fully appreciated unless one has first familiarized oneself by reading the various accounts of Alexander, especially those written by his ancient biographers.  I may be reading too much into it, but I think the central theme of the Stone film is given us when, on Alexander's wedding night, he responds to his new bride""s question about whether he loves Hephaestion by saying, ""There are many kinds of love, Roxane.""  Oliver Stone's Alexander has many loves - his father, his mother, Hephaestion, Bagoas, the army, glory, war, his vision of a united world empire - and his attempts to give full devotion to each one drive his extraordinary career and, it would seem, eventually lead to his own self-destruction."
Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,This one is similar to the ones I bought at a local gun show for my Dad.  The other is not the same but a bit different.  The one on the left is a regular one and the one on the right is a special one.  The two are very similar.  The one on the left is the one I had last year on my first outing with the gun and my Dad had one of these as a present.  I like that the one on the right is a special one for me and my Dad.  I'm not sure how the design of the gun will work but it's definitely different than the one on the left.  It's a little different from the one on the right but I don't think I can tell if it's a good design.  It's a little different from the one on the left
Electronics_5,5.0,CG,"I just received the item and it arrived on time. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that the case is very thin and doesn't protect the tablet perfectly.  It is very thin and it will hang on the tablet without issue.  I will keep it as a backup when I need to go to the office or when I need to carry around some extra items.  It is very hard to pull out the cover and it will not fold up very well.  I am very disappointed that the case is not thicker.  It would be nice if it had a rubber cover to protect the tablet.This is a great camera for the price.

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is a book about a young man with a dark past and a young woman with a future on which she placed all of her faith. Lucas hadn't known Jacqueline, but he had watched her from a distance. Jacqueline didn't even know that Lucas truly existed until one night he saved her from a horrible incident. Now it seems as if she keeps running into him. Jacqueline can't get him out of her head. Lucas is the ""bad boy"" with the tattoos to go along with that stereotype. He is sexy in every way. He's good looking, has tattoos, is mysterious, and knows how to teach a girl how to defend herself. Jacqueline can't seem to keep herself away from the mystery of him. This book is full of angst and passion, and takes you through the journey of falling in love and lust.
 I fell in love with this book! I enjoyed the mystery that surrounded Lucas and the love/lust that Lucas and Jacqueline shared. This was a book that was written to emulate real life, which was a nice break from all the fantasy I have been reading. I thought this book was going to just be a love/lust book with not much else going on, but there was an adventure presented by the incidents that happened as well as deception. I was entertained through the whole length.
I found out that there will be a second book, Breakable, being released May 6, 2014. You better believe that I have already pre-ordered it!

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time."

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,CG,"My 4 cats LOVE this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. If you don't get a solid piece, the plastic part will slip off and slip off. I have to drill a hole in the center for it to slide back in. The only way to put it together is to leave it in the car and then put a strong towel over it and just put a nail in it. But if you don't have a good idea of how to do that, you probably won't be able to figure out how to put it together.

Overall, it's a great toy. It's a good size for my two cats. They'll play with it and it's a good size for my 18 lb. Yorkie. I'll be buying another one for when I have to pull it out of the car.

Pet_Supplies_5,5.0,OR,"I have a golden retriever that is my service dog. He has been working with me for over three years now. He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

I hope that this review has been helpful to you!"

Books_5,5.0,OR,"This is still the best biographical introduction to the poet Emily Dickinson but it was written in the l970s and tends to include only  material denigrating Susan Dickinson from bystanders from that era. Since Sewall's book, more information about the relationship between Emily and Susan has been uncovered and sheds new light on the subject. In addition, Sewall leaned heavily on material provided by Mabel Loomis Todd about Susan that is - shall we say - one-sided. The book is particularly strong on Emily Dickinson's forbears, family and early years and for this and more I highly recommend it. The chapters on Otis Lord and Samuel Bowles are particularly revealing."

She is exploring her own desires and sexuality as a woman. You should not be embarrassed about your sexuality and any fantasies that you have and by the end of this book, I think she came to terms with that. Tanner of course helps her with her self discovery. Her passion excites him and it just brings them closer together. Can't wait for the next one. Only two left. I'll be sad when it ends.

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"Prior to buying these rings I was working out on a bar, and find the rings to be much more versatile and potent.  They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.  These are excellent quality and way more than worth the purchase price."

The whole thing - every page - from beginning to end is sardonic and ingeniusly written.  The humor is not restricted to just one format.  There are hilarious forms to fill out, games to play and paragraphs that made me flat-out laugh and giggle.

Kindle_Store_5,4.0,OR,"I have not read the first book so that might have made a difference to how I saw this book. It was very hard for me to get into the book but I kept going as it was gifted to me and I wanted to read it to the end to give an honest review. I do plan to go and get book one and then re-read this book after and see if my review changes.

It took me til about the middle of the book to get with the program. I love mythology and all but it was very confusing to me with Loki and some of the other references. Now Raven (a Valkyrie ) and Mangus (a Wolf Shifter or Einherjer) were one Hot couple when they were together and  of course that was not never enough at all in this book.  The biker gangs and all the names from both were so many they helped with the confusion as well but like I said all in all once I got into the book it was a 4 star read. There was enough depth and heat in it that I do plan to read the book 1 in the series and  plan to read the next book as well. I do advise  reading book one first as it most likely will help you understand more in this book."

Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"This is the second book in Living with Lies series and picks up where book 1 Living with Lies finished.

This book centred on Belle, Isabelle Paasch who was Damian's daughter by all accounts and purposes.  Belle's life was sheltered and controlled in every one of her 21 years growing up in Mexico with Damian. He loved her with all his heart and protected her to the point she could do nothing a normal teenager and young adult should have experienced at her age, he was frightened of anyone getting to her and using her as a bargaining chip or worse against his life and to take his control and power.
After having to move in with Kate her sister/cousin she met Kiran and wow, their chemistry was obvious straight away. Kieran  has a heart of gold but was guarded from events in his past and did his best to keep his distance from Belle but they both just couldn't stay away from each other no matter how hard they tried to hate each other.
This book took you on a roller coaster of emotions and was hard to put down once you started.
Belle really surprised me with her strength and determination to keep the ones she loves safe and away from the nightmare of a life she has been brought up in.
Damian was amazing and I fell in love with him the moment he made his entrance known, he is strong, controlling but more than that he is someone that would die to keep his family safe and I would
Love to read more of!
I have to say Damien was my absolute favourite in this book and he has definitely won my heart along with Isabelle and Kate.

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,OR,"When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund."

As to the loose handle, a pair of #47 O-rings (AS-568 #009), easily available at any hardware or home improvement store, will give you the ability to remove the handle as needed, or use it in any position along it's length without falling out - a feature I like."

Pros: Look, fit, accuracy, simplicity
Cons: Customer service"

Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,OR,"Got this game as a game my 2 year old could play with while I played board games with the older children. He wanted to be involved with our game, but was very happy to be involved with his shape game and in fact asks for it on his own now. There are many different ways the game can be played as the kid/s grow, or it can simply be used as preschool material teaching colors and shapes. This is a winner in our house!"

Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"Edit:  I contacted the manufacturer, explained my situation and they sent me more pins for free.  I can now update my review from a 2 to 5 stars.
The set is good but I have a couple issues. First, it did not come with a tool to help remove Defiant round handles (Defiant and kwickset are interchangeable) These need a small round point and it only came with slot type tool. Second, and the worst part for me at least, the new keys it came with requires two of the same color pin for each key. This means I only have enough pins to rekey 3 locks instead of up to 6 it claims on the package. Now I need to make a purchase of a pin set that I shouldn't need. I will contact the manufacturer to see if they will ship them for free."

The only reason I gave it four  stars, instead of five, was because the top of the ship and a few other pieces do come off and on very easily, which can frustrate the kids and you. Despite that I would definitely buy again."

Toys_and_Games_5,3.0,OR,"This is probably entertaining for a baby who can sit but is not mobile... although it might scare babies that age. Considering the price of this toy and the added cost of the battery needed to run it, I say pass on this toy and buy something else! My daughter got this for her birthday and has played with this probably 15 whole minutes, if that (she is 16 months old now). The motor is so loud you can't hear the music over it, and it just doesn't keep her attention for long at all. The loud noise may scare your kid, it has scared my daughter a few times when she hits it by accident. One thing I like about this toy is when my cats accidentally hit it it goes off and it is pretty hilarious watching them scurry, since they aren't supposed to be in her playroom. Giving it three stars because it does what it advertises it does, but pretty much is boring and not very entertaining for my one year old, and there are cheaper and more entertaining toys out there."
Tools_and_Home_Improvement_5,5.0,OR,"One of the best purchases I have made this decade.  I have a woman....and ""older"" woman who just does not have the grip that I used to for home repairs.  I have tried various electric screwdrivers from name-brand companies like Black and Decker but they just did not give me the push I needed.  A friend recommended this from across the Country, so he had to convince me that....no, it is not too heavy for me.  Yes, it is very easy to grip, load, and charge.  Yes, it has plenty of power and will hold the charge through all my projects!  He recommended that I just get a board and put screws in it, then reverse and take out.  I did....I only needed to do that twice before I was all over the inside and outside of my house taking care of those long-awaited projects.  I actually laid it down in the kitchen and forgot where I put in a week ago.  I thought I was going to go through withdrawal!  I have been using this tool at least every other day since I got it and am now creating new projects to use it with.  Trust this girl who has more power tools than most men!"

Books_5,5.0,CG,Very interesting read.  It was an easy read and a good read.  I would recommend it
Books_5,4.0,OR,"The storyline alternates between primarily two perspectives (a blind French girl and a German orphan boy) and timeframes until everything all comes together as France is being liberated from Germany at the end of WWII.

The prose is beautiful, and really places you the moment. It was particularly interesting to read from Marie-Laure's perspective, since, being blind, the way she would describe scenes was a very unique take. I also really enjoyed the way it portrayed WWII. This was not good vs evil, it was just two people who happened to be on two different sides of the war and were doing everything they could to survive. You feel connected with each character, which is hard to do when you know they are ultimately meant to be enemies. It's a really endearing and touching historical fiction account of WWII.

My only criticism would be the ending. Since the chapters are very short and the timeline constantly moving around, you get the sense that it's building to a huge climax. Personally, I found that climax to be a bit anti-climactic. But overall, that detracted very little from my enjoyment of the novel and would recommend to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, WWII, or well-written literature."
Kindle_Store_5,5.0,OR,"Though sometimes the translation is a bit awkward, the story is great. I only hope that the conclusion I've reached about the final book is not correct!

Electronics_5,5.0,OR,"This is a great little speaker.  I was impressed at how loud it got.  Sure, it doesn't have the same low end and clarity that a $300 speaker does, but this thing is great at this price point.  I was able to turn it on and connect my phone right out of the box.  I was playing music within 10 seconds of opening the box.  I was really impressed with the solid, sturdy feel and especially like the rubbery texture.  It feels much more expensive than it actually is.  It also has an auxiliary port which comes in handy if you happen to have an older mp3 player or something that doesn't have bluetooth support.  I don't expect I'll ever need to use it, but it is a nice addition.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review."

Sports_and_Outdoors_5,5.0,CG,Outstanding fuel.  This is a real fuel cell stove.  My husband and I have been using this stove for over a year now.  The stove is very easy to set up and maintain.  We have been using it for a few days now.  The burner has a lot of power.  The burner is the most efficient type of fuel source available.  It has a very nice height for the stove and a nice height for the stove itself.  The burner is very convenient for camping or backpacking.  The burner is very portable and easy to store.

Clothing_Shoes_and_Jewelry_5,3.0,OR,"These shoes are so comfortable you will not want to take them off.  Even my sensitive feet with bunions are very happy in them.  True, they are not very elegant, since they look somewhat bulky, but at this point I prefer comfort over style.  The inner sole is soft suede with some cushioning underneath. I don't think the insole is real suede, rather it is microfiber and the upper lining is definitely synthetic fabric.

I bought black size 9.5 M and they are both slightly longer (26.7 cm=10.5 in) and seem wider than most medium widths since the fabric mesh allows more width flexibility above the sole.  They are not suitable for persons with very low or very high insteps as the zipper on top does not provide any width regulation (unless you leave the zipper partially open). The upper opening does not fit snugly on my low instep foot.  However the back sling has some elastic under the buckle, so the length is flexible and can be additionally adjusted by pin holes - I had to use the first pin hole. So, I would label them at least 9.5 W. I lowered the rating for incorrect sizing to fours stars.

The insole has perforations under the ball of the foot, which means the moisture gets under the lining and ... the odor stays longer. I used them in tropical weather (on a cruise, both on the ship and on the land) for less than a month and they already stink, though I do not have any sweating problem.

I also got surprised that my French shellac pedicure got stained, not only on the white strips, but on the clear body of the nails as well. My black microfiber suede tote bag also stained my French manicure, so this is the fault of the fabric stain (and shellac polish vulnerability). Maybe the light colored sandals don't stain though.

I lowered the ratings to three after one month due to these two problems."
Toys_and_Games_5,5.0,CG,"So where do I start?

First off, I need to make sure I get the correct size so I can fit the gun in the right position. This is a very large gun, so it's not really a problem. If you are going to use it as a full sized gun, it's a good idea to get a larger size. If you are going to use it for a kid, it's a good idea to get a larger size.

Secondly, if you have a kid who is going to be a little bit older, you need to be careful not to break it off. If you have a kid who is going to be a little bit younger, you may want to take the gun apart. This can be difficult for them to handle, but it's a good idea to put the gun back in the right place.

Thirdly, I need to get the correct size for the gun. I've had some issues with the paint being a bit on the gun and the gun's head not coming off. I'll update this post if I find a better solution.

All in all, I was very happy with this purchase!  It's a great toy!  It's very nice quality, and it's perfect for little hands!Very fun.  Will buy again.This is a good toy for my 2 year old.  She loves to play with it."

Movies_and_TV_5,4.0,CG,"This has all the Alien features of the first movie. I saw it on a VHS and was a little disappointed. The movie itself is good but the acting is not great. The movie takes place in the future where the Alien is sent to Earth. This is a far cry from the first movie. The movie is the most realistic movie I have seen on the Alien franchise. I will say that the acting is not bad. The movie is very realistic and a good way to show that the Alien is real. The alien is a very scary creature that is not scary at all. There is a scene where the Alien is said to be a ""little kid"". The movie is filled with references to other movies and to a horror movie. It is a scary movie to see how it is made. I wish there were more movies like this on the DVD. I will say that the movies are not bad. I recommend that you buy the movie. I recommend that you watch this movie. This is a great movie and worth watching."

I have a portable sink and I can use the hose to remove the water from the sink.  This works great for the price too.

Books_5,4.0,OR,"""Andi Under Pressure"" by Amanda Flower, is a great mystery novel for kids, based on cute, realistic characters and an intriguing plot.  Twelve-year-old Andi Boggs and her friend Colin are thrilled to be attending a prestigious science camp at a university in Kildeer, Ohio.  But from day one, the camp is plagued with a series of pranks which slowly escalate to the point of being dangerous.  Andi and Colin, being extremely curious and fairly fearless, decide to put their investigative prowess to good use, and in true Nancy Drew-esque fashion, they get themselves into pickles and seemingly impossible situations pretty often.
I would recommend this book to anybody who has kids who enjoy a good mystery novel.  The plot is interesting and draws the reader in right away. (I read the whole thing on a 3 hour flight this past weekend). The characters have good hearts and positive goals and the book is clean and safe for young readers.  Lessons about integrity and honesty are sprinkled throughout the story but they are underlying themes more than overt lessons.  In addition to the mystery, there are good moments of both humor and drama, creating a very well rounded reading experience for any kid.  This was my first Amanda Flower book and I would definitely be eager to read more of her work.
